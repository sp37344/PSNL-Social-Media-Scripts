And I'm like, ""Wait, she's a troll!"" For young females to get to see that, I was like, ""Whoa, that's not frivolous at all. That's so important."" And what a cool way into getting them into the theater — 'I wanna be like Princess Poppy, not Barbie.'""

I'd like to take a minute, with your indulgence, to add my voice to the heap. Because this is not just a U.S. issue. This is a human issue that has implications for all of us; American and non-American citizens like myself.

Persecution against any group for religious beliefs or race is illegal and unconstitutional in the U.S. Period.

This isn't just an attack on Muslims or refugees — this is an attack on all humans and in particular, the ones most in need of protection. Right now, worldwide, 28 million children have been uprooted by conflict, driven from their homes by violence and terror. Children know no nations and no borders; those who survive will grow up to follow the lead of those who take them in. Do we show them love and acceptance? Or allow them to fend for themselves, vulnerable to guerrilla groups that will only teach them to perpetuate this cycle of violence?

We have to be vigilant about letting bigotry and hatred creep into the mainstream or be rationalized under the guise of ""protecting our people."" If we accept blanket targeting towards Muslims, we can all be sure that other minority groups won't be far behind, whether it's by closing borders to other supposed ""dangerous"" groups or trampling their human rights in other ways.

Muslims are our people. They are human beings with children, needs and dreams like the rest of us. Not all Muslims are terrorists, and by the way, not all terrorists are Muslims.

Latinos are our people. They don't come to ""steal jobs"" — they come seeking an opportunity to build a better life for themselves and for their children, which is what the U.S. has always prided itself on representing: opportunities. They are a huge part of the workforce that has contributed to making America the great country it is today.

African Americans are our people. After enduring centuries of oppression and the countless human atrocities that were committed against them, after fighting for civil rights, it's devastating that racial profiling is still happening and their civil liberties are still being threatened.

I could go on naming groups ad infinitum, but the point is, we shouldn't be singling out groups and differentiating them by race, class or religion, because according to the Constitution, all of that is irrelevant to their rights as a citizen. Anybody who goes to the U.S. and chooses to raise that flag and uphold those principles is ""our people.""

Thanks to social networks, we all have a platform to use our voice today. For every post I see with hateful language, I see others that lift my spirits and reassure me that we haven't totally lost our way. Lawyers in airports offering free counsel to refugees, New Yorkers banding together on the subway to erase neo-Nazi vandalism, doctors volunteering their time to give free advice to women that need it, and citizen activists marching for equal rights for all.

Let's keep tipping the scales in favor of ""liberty and justice for all,"" keep using our voices to lift up others and speak out for those whose voices have been stripped from them. I applaud all of you who have spoken out against the ban—keep up the good fight and never back down. #resist","9 nominaciones!

For some, the world goes to sleep at night. For others, it comes alive. This weekend, the goal is to capture both sides of that spectrum: the bright energy and the quiet rest.

Here are some tips to get you started:

Whether it's calming down or speeding up, notice how the energy shifts. Document your family settling in for dinner or take a Boomerang of your friends hitting the town. 

Focus on light. Whether it's the blue hue of dusk spreading over your neighborhood or a city skyline illuminated against the night sky, notice how light changes and evolves from bright to dim. 

Look beyond your immediate circle — how do other people react to the shift from day to night? Take a portrait of a server heading to work or a video of downtown streets emptying as office workers head home.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPgoodnight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

A moment of childhood joy stars in our #BoomerangOfTheWeek.","Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPnaturalbeauty

Our planet is a timeless source of discovery, wonder and inspiration. This weekend, let's celebrate Earth's beauty. 

Here are a few tips to get you started:

Spend time in a majestic landscape. Mountains, beaches, plains, forests — our land is diverse and grand, and it would take lifetimes to experience it all. How much can you capture within the frame of one photograph or video? Look for action and movement within the larger scene.

Focus on the smaller details. Our planet may be vast, but there are millions of tiny, beautiful moments playing out in front of us every day: a blooming flower pushing through the cracks in the sidewalk, a trickle of water feeding a small pool in the forest or a tree swaying gently in the breeze. 

Keep an eye out for how nature weaves its way into man-made scenes. City and country alike have their own elements of natural beauty.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPnaturalbeauty hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

Tap and hold the bookmark icon underneath any post to save it directly to a collection. You can create and name a new collection when you save a post, or you can add it to one you've already created. You can also create a collection out of your existing saved posts. Tap the plus icon in the top right corner, give your collection a name and select the saved posts you'd like to add. 

You can find your collections on the saved posts tab on your profile. Just like all saved posts, your collections are private — only you can see them. Since we introduced the ability to save posts last December, 46 percent of Instagrammers have saved at least one post. Whether you want to plan your next day trip, revisit your favorite artists' illustrations or always have some animal videos on hand, collections can help you keep track of the posts you want to remember.

This one's for you, early risers. The goal this weekend is to take photos and videos that capture the sights and sounds of the world waking up.

Here are a few tips to get started:

Take advantage of soft morning light, whether it streams through your bedroom window or lights your favorite hiking trail at sunrise.

Record quiet moments with your family before the day starts moving: still-sleeping portraits, steam rising off a cup of fresh coffee and reading the newspaper together.

Consider morning moments that aren't slow — not everyone has the weekends off of work. Take a Hyperlapse of the vendors setting up the fish market before the sun comes up, or a Boomerang of park ranger out in the field.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPgoodmorning hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Learn how to #Boomerang like Alina Valitova ✨,"Today, we're introducing new sticker tools that help you be even more creative, whether you're sharing to your story or having conversations with your friends in Direct. Over 200 million people now use Instagram Stories every day to keep up with friends and accounts they love. And with recent updates to Direct, it's never been easier to have playful, visual conversations with close friends. With these new sticker tools, you have even more ways to turn your most casual, everyday moments into something fun to share.

Turn your selfie into a sticker that you can use throughout your story. You'll see a new sticker with a camera icon that lets you capture a mini-selfie. Before or after capturing, tap to apply different frame styles. Put your selfie sticker anywhere, adjust the size and use as many other creative tools as you want. You can also now pin your selfie sticker — as well as any other sticker or text — to a specific spot in your video. Just tap and hold the sticker, move it over any object and confirm by tapping ""Pin."" 

If you live in or are traveling to Chicago, London, Madrid or Tokyo, you'll also start seeing geostickers for your city over the coming days. All of the geostickers have been designed by local community members to help bring the cities they call home to life. You'll be able to see the artist's username when you tap the sticker, so you can learn more about their unique artwork.

We're also rolling out a shortcut to get to your favorite stickers. After tapping the smiley face, simply swipe right to see your recently used stickers. Finally, when you record a video using ""Hands-Free"" mode, tap and hold the button to see a timer that counts down to when the video begins.

Texts and reshares will now appear in the same thread with disappearing photos and videos so you can seamlessly go back and forth with your friends.

Send a disappearing photo or video to let your friends know what you're up to, a funny selfie to capture the mood or share what's happening around you. Simply swipe left into Direct and tap the new blue camera icon at the bottom to take a disappearing photo or video, or tap the blue camera icon in an existing thread. As always, swiping right from feed will take you directly to the camera. Tap the arrow to send it to individual friends or groups of friends.

When you receive new disappearing messages, they'll be highlighted blue in your inbox. Tap to view them and you can replay them once. The sender will be notified if you replay or screenshot the message. Texts, uploads and reshares still work the same way. Since our last update in November 2016, the number of people using Direct has grown from 300 million to 375 million.

Triangles in a building's design. Rectangular lines in the forest. Circular food on your circular plate. This weekend, the goal is to make images and videos of the shapes and structures in your everyday surroundings. 

Here are some tips to get you started: 

Choose a particular shape and keep an eye out for it anywhere you may go. Whether you're in a dense urban grid or the vastness of a forest, there are shapes hidden in plain sight. 

Change up your perspective — look down, up, at close-up details and faraway scenes — sometimes new shapes will present themselves. 

Look for repetition of a favorite shape in one scene. Maybe a cyclist is riding by a house with circular windows, or you're sitting down to lunch and see that your napkin is folded in the same triangle as your sandwich.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPgeometric hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

""Queen Sugar"" is one of the sexiest shows in recent memory, and that plus some familiar prodigal-child story beats might make it seem like an expendable soap.

Miss your scent... 💩,Happy belated birthday chicken bud ! deadly week with ya @niall_hardi ...... #US,"Let's celebrate one of the greatest players to ever put an Irish jersey on as he announces his retirement from international football .  When I was a kid my dad had a ten year ticket for landsdowne road in the east stand . We went to every single home Irish game from as long as I can remember . Without fail every Irish jersey I owned had 'Keane 10' on the back and I would walk up to the ground on freezing cold Wednesday night in Dublin to watch the boys in green and excited by the idea of Robbie Keane scoring and adding to his tally of goals he has for Ireland .  Robbie gave the Irish fans some of our greatest moments and brought so much joy to a small nation when he put that jersey on. The greatest thing about Robbie is that everytime he put on the jersey you could literally see him bursting with pride and everyone fed off that .  Over the last few years I've been lucky enough to call Robbie and Claudine my really good friends and I hide nothing. I tell rob all the time that he's my idol and was a big part of my childhood even down to when I would try and do my hair like his( state of him ) .  Rob thanks for everything , we'll miss ya banging goals in for the boys in green . 🇮🇪🇮🇪",What a night that was !! #ufc202 #mcgregor  #diaz #battle .. Very happy I was able to attend .,Incredible !

--------------------------------------
Friends, Members of Congress, Ambassadors, Veterans and, most especially, to the Survivors here with us today: it is an honor to join you on this solemn occasion. I am deeply moved to stand before those who survived history's darkest hour. Your cherished presence transforms this place into a sacred gathering.

Thank you, Tom Bernstein, Alan Holt, Sara Bloomfield, and everyone at the Holocaust Memorial Council and Museum for your vital work and tireless contributions.

We are privileged to be joined by Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer. The State of Israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the Jewish People. A fervent dream that burned in the hearts of the oppressed, is now filled with the breath of life – and the Star of David waves atop a great nation arisen from the desert.

To those in the audience who have served America in uniform: our country thanks you. We are proud and grateful to be joined today by Veterans of the Second World War who liberated survivors from the Camps. Your sacrifice helped save freedom for the world. 

Sadly, this year marks the first Day of Remembrance since the passing of Elie Wiesel.

His absence leaves an empty space in our hearts, but his spirit fills this room – it is the kind and gentle spirit of an angel who lived through hell, and whose courage still lights the path from darkness.

Though ELL-EE's story is well known, it is always worth repeating. He suffered the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust. His mother and sister perished at Auschwitz. He watched his father slowly dying before his own young eyes in Buchenwald. He lived through an endless nightmare of murder and death – and he inscribed on our collective conscience the duty we have to remember that long dark night so as never to repeat it.

The Survivors in this hall, through their testimony, fulfill the righteous duty to never forget – and engrave into the world's memory the Nazi Genocide of the Jewish People.

You witnessed evil beyond description. Many of you lost your entire family – everything and everyone you loved. You saw mothers and children led to mass slaughter. You saw the starvation and the torture. You saw the organized attempt at the extermination of an entire people. You survived the ghettos, the Concentration Camps and the Death Camps. And you persevered to tell your stories. You tell of these living nightmares because, despite your great pain, you believe in ELL-EE's famous plea, that ""For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.""  

That is why we are here today. To remember and to bear witness. To make sure that humanity, never, ever forgets. The Nazis massacred 6 million Jews. Two out of every three Jews in Europe were murdered in the genocide. Millions more innocent people were imprisoned and executed by the Nazis without mercy.

Yet, even today, there are those who want to forget the past – worse still, there are even those filled with such hate that they want to erase the Holocaust from history. Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to its evil, and we will never be silent in the face of evil again.

Denying the Holocaust is only one of many forms of dangerous Anti-Semitism that continue around the world. We've seen Anti-Semitism on university campuses, in the public square, and in threats against Jewish citizens. Even worse, it's been on display in the most sinister manner when terrorists attack Jewish Communities – or when aggressors threaten Israel with destruction.

This is my pledge to you: 
We will confront Anti-Semitism. 
We will stamp out prejudice.  
We will condemn hatred.  
We will bear witness. 
And we will act.

As President of the United States, I will always stand with the Jewish people – and I will always stand with our great friend and partner, the State of Israel.

So today, we remember the 6 million Jewish men, women and children whose lives and dreams were stolen from this earth. 

We remember the millions of other innocent victims the Nazis so brutally targeted and killed.

We remember the survivors who bore more than we can imagine.

We remember the hatred and evil that sought to extinguish human life, dignity, and freedom.
But we also remember the light that shone through the darkness.

We remember sisters and brothers who gave everything to those they loved – survivors like Steven Springfield who in the long death march carried his brother on his back. As he said, ""I just couldn't give in.""

We remember the brave souls who banded together to save the lives of their neighbors – even at the risk of their own.

And we remember those first hopeful moments of liberation, when at long last the American soldiers arrived in camps and cities throughout occupied Europe – waving the same beautiful flags before us today, speaking those three glorious words: ""you are free.""

It is this love of freedom, this embrace of human dignity – this call to courage in the face of evil – that the Survivors here today have helped to write onto our hearts. The Jewish people have endured oppression, persecution, and those who have sought and planned their destruction. Yet, through the suffering, they have persevered. They have thrived. And they have enlightened the world.
We stand in awe of the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish People.

I want to close with a story – enshrined in the Museum – that captures the moment of liberation in the final days of the war.

It is the story of Gerda Klein, a young Jewish woman from Poland. Some of you know her. Gerda's family was murdered by the Nazis. She spent three years imprisoned in labor camps – and the last four months of the war on a terrible death march. At the end, on the eve of her 21st birthday, her hair had lost all of its color, and she weighed a mere 68 pounds. Yet she had the will to live another day.  
 
Gerda later recalled the moment she realized that her long-awaited deliverance had arrived. She saw a car coming towards her. Many cars had driven up before. But this one was different. On its hood, in place of that wretched swastika, was a bright, beautiful white star.
 
Two American soldiers got out. One walked up to her. The first thing Gerda said was what she had been trained to say: ""We are Jewish, you know.""
 
That American soldier paused. And then he said, ""so am I.""
 
It was a beautiful moment after so much darkness.
 
As Gerda took this solider to see the other prisoners, the American did something she had long forgotten to even expect: he opened the door for her.
 
In Gerda's words, ""that was the moment of restoration of humanity, of humaneness, dignity, and freedom.""
 
But the story does not end there. Because as some of you know, that young American soldier who liberated her, and who showed her such decency, would soon become her husband. A year later, they were married.
 
In her words, ""He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and my future.""
 
Gerda has since spent her life telling the world of what she witnessed. She, like those Survivors among us today, has dedicated her life to shining a light of hope through the dark of night.
 
Your courage strengthens us. Your voices inspire us. And your stories remind us that we must never, ever, shrink away from telling the truth about evil in our time.
 
Evil is always seeking to wage war against the innocent, and to destroy all that is good and beautiful about our common humanity.
 
But evil can only thrive in darkness.
 
And what you have brought us today is so much more powerful than evil. You have brought us hope. Hope that love will conquer hatred, that right will defeat wrong, and that peace will rise from the ashes of war.
 
Each Survivor here today is a beacon of light – and it only takes one light to illuminate even the darkest space. Just like it takes only one truth to crush a thousand lies, and one hero to change the course of history.
 
We know that in the end, good will triumph over evil.  And that as long as we refuse to close our eyes, or to silence our voices, we know that justice will ultimately prevail.
 
So today we mourn. We remember. We pray. And we pledge: NEVER AGAIN.
 
Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.

-----------------------------------
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
 
A PROCLAMATION
 
On Yom HaShoah  the day of Holocaust Remembrance  and during this Week of Remembrance, we honor the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution.  
 
​The Holocaust was the state-sponsored, systematic persecution and attempted annihilation of European Jewry by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. By the end of World War II, six million Jews had been brutally slaughtered. The Nazis also targeted other groups for persecution and murder, including Roma (Gypsies), persons with mental and physical disabilities, Soviet prisoners of war, Jehovah's Witnesses, Slavs and other peoples of Europe, gays, and political opponents.
 
​The United States stands shoulder to shoulder with the survivors of the Holocaust, their families, and the descendants of those who were murdered. We support the Jewish diaspora and the State of Israel as we fulfill our duty to remember the victims, honor their memory and their lives, and celebrate humanity's victory over tyranny and evil.  Holocaust survivors, despite scars from history's darkest days, continue to inspire us to remember the past and learn from its lessons. By sharing their experiences and wisdom, they continue to fuel our resolve to advance human rights and to combat antisemitism and other forms of hatred.
 
​During this week in 1945, American and Allied forces liberated the concentration camp at Dachau and other Nazi death camps, laying bare to the world the unconscionable horror of the Holocaust. We must remain vigilant against hateful ideologies and indifference.  Every generation must learn and apply the lessons of the Holocaust so that such horror, atrocity, and genocide never again occur. It is our solemn obligation to reaffirm our commitment to respecting the fundamental freedoms and inherent dignity of every human being.
 
​Let us join together to remember and honor the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution. We express our eternal gratitude to the liberators who selflessly risked their lives to save those of others, and we pledge to never be bystanders to evil.
 
​We must never forget.​
 
​NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby ask the people of the United States to observe the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, April 23 through April 30, 2017, and the solemn anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camps, with appropriate study, prayers and commemoration, and to honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution by internalizing the lessons of this atrocity so that it is never repeated.
 
​IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of April, in the year two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

The explosive Chris Gayle, the first man to cross 10,000 T20 runs, joins us in the second part of this episode of 'Life Beyond Cricket.' Gayle tells Mithila Mehta how he loves to clown around. In the episode he also reveals which cricketer is his favourite target. ""I can make you laugh till you cry,"" he quips!

Gayle tells us about his friendship with the world's fastest man, Usain Bolt. Where do they usually meet and what do they talk about?

He may not have seen too many Bollywood movies, but Gayle says he feels like he's right in a Bollywood movie when he steps out to bat and hears the crowd erupt (""Just like Mr. Bachchan, I get the same cheers as well."")","FB 1703 - क्षमा प्रार्थी हूँ , लेकिन अंत में हम सब, जो इस Film उद्योग में एक कलाकार के रूप में सम्बंदित हैं  , बस इसी तरह जाने जाएंगे - एक POSTER  के रूप में   !!!","FB 1703 - Sent by a well wisher .. ~

*बोध* *कथा* •••
एक बार नदी को अपने पानी के प्रचंड प्रवाह पर घमंड हो गया। नदी को लगा कि मुझमें इतनी ताकत है कि मैं पहाड़, मकान, पेड़, पशु, मानव आदि सभी को बहाकर ले जा सकती हूँ। एक दिन नदी ने बड़े गर्वीले अंदाज में समुद्र से कहा - बताओ ! मैं तुम्हारे लिए क्या क्या लाऊँ ? मकान, पशु, मानव, वृक्ष आदि जो तुम चाहो, उसे मैं जड़ से उखाड़कर ला सकती हूँ।

समुद्र समझ गया कि नदी को अहंकार हो गया है। उसने नदी से कहा यदि तुम मेरे लिए कुछ लाना चाहती हो तो, थोड़ी सी घास उखाड़कर ले आओ। नदी ने कहा बस ! इतनी सी बात ! अभी लेकर आती हूँ। नदी ने अपने जल का पुरा जोर लगाया पर घास नहीं उखड़ी। नदी ने कई बार  जोर लगाया पर असफलता ही हाथ लगी। आखिर नदी हारकर समुद्र के पास पहुँची और बोली। मैं वृक्ष, मकान, पहाड़ आदि तो उखाड़कर ला सकती। जब भी  घास को उखाड़ने के लिए पुरा जोर लगाती हूं तो वह नीचे की ओर झुक जाती है और मैं खाली हाथ उपर से गुजर जाती हूं।

समुद्र ने नदी की पूरी बात ध्यान से सुनी और मुस्कुराते हुए बोला  - *जो* *पहाड़* *और* *वृक्ष* *जैसे* *कठोर* *होते* *है*, *ये* *आसानी* *से* *उखड़* *जाते* *है*, *किन्तु* *घास* *जैसी* *विनम्रता* *जिसने* *सीख* *ली* *हो*, *उसे* *प्रचंड* *आंधी* *तूफान* या* प्रचंड* *वेग* *भी* नहीं उखाड़ सकता।","FB 1703 - World Book Day , 23 rd  April  .. !!

बोलो कब प्रतिकार करोगे 
पूछ रहा अस्तित्व तुम्हारा 
कब तक ऐसे वार सहोगे 
बोलो कब प्रतिकार करोगे 

अग्नि वृद्ध होती जाती है 
यौवन निर्झर छूट रहा है
प्रत्यंचा भर्रायी सी है 
धनुष तुम्हारा टूट रहा है 
कब तुम सच स्वीकार करोगे 
बोलो कब प्रतिकार करोगे 

कम्पन है वीणा के स्वर में 
याचक सारे छन्द हो रहे 
रीढ़ गर्व खोती जाती है 
निर्णय सारे मंद हो रहे 
क्या अब हाहाकार करोगे 
बोलो कब प्रतिकार करोगे

तिमिर लिए रथ निकल पड़ा है 
संसारी आक्रोश हो रहा 
झुकता है संकल्प तुम्हारा 
श्वेत धवल वह रोष खो रहा 
कैसे सागर पार करोगे 
बोलो कब प्रतिकार करोगे 

कब तक रक्त मौन बैठेगा
सत्य कलश छलकाना होगा 
स्वप्न बीज भी सुप्त हो रहा 
धरा स्नान करना होगा 
किस दिन तुम संहार करोगे 
बोलो कब प्रतिकार करोगे

To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain
Of the sensual man-in-the-street
And the lie of Authority
Whose buildings grope the sky:
There is no such thing as the State
And no one exists alone;
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or the police;
We must love one another or die.

Defenceless under the night
Our world in stupor lies;
Yet, dotted everywhere,
Ironic points of light
Flash out wherever the Just
Exchange their messages:
May I, composed like them
Of Eros and of dust,
Beleaguered by the same
Negation and despair,
Show an affirming flame.

Rock in Rio,"This beautiful woman raised me to be a hard worker, highly intelligent and extremely capable all on her own. I grew up in a tough city and I am forever in awe of my mother's strength and perseverance. And while we as women have come a long way since the days when my mom was raising me, it's crazy that we are STILL having the conversation that women are paid on average 20% LESS than men. Crazier still that if we closed the wage gap, black working mothers alone would have enough money each year to either pay for four more years of food, three and a half additional years of childcare or two and a half more years of rent. Imagine what closing the gap would mean for ALL women! Let's hold each other up, stand together and speak up to close the gender pay gap. #20PercentCounts #EqualPayDay","Excited to celebrate art, life, and creativity at the #BKArtistsBall with my love Swizz Beatz.

A reminder of why we need gender equality for everyone. So brave! 💜,"At times, politics may seem disillusioning, filled with rhetoric and smokescreens. However, regardless of our personal beliefs, it can't be denied that the result of the upcoming US presidential election will have ripple effects around the world and impact, in one way or another, the lives of millions and millions of people.

America is my second home. I have friends there that I think of as family. It has been excruciating to sit on the sidelines in the months leading up to this election. Goodness, I wish I could cast a vote. We know one of the most reliable indicators of peace and prosperity, nationally and globally, is not a country's level of wealth, democracy, or ethno-religious identity; but how well its women and girls are treated (Sex and World Peace by Valerie Hudson). The next president will be able to make decisions about women, about their bodies, about how they are treated at work, on university campuses and at school, about how men treat women and about their rights as citizens. These decisions affect how young people form their ideas of gender. 

These decisions will affect whether we believe equality is an idea that matters. 
 
In 2014, I tweeted Desmond Tutu's quote: ""Men and boys, we show our manhood by how we treat our women"". The American men I know and love know this. They know that the way a man treats women can't be overlooked or brushed aside. 

In the last US election, 70 million women cast ballots versus 60 million men. Women, your vote could swing this election. Please go out and vote on the 8th of November. Read up on both sides of your state propositions (if you have any). 

You have real power to decide the future of generations to come.

Thank you President Mutharika for being a #HeForShe Impact Champion and for making gender equality a priority in your Government! Thank you to all the traditional leaders who are implementing President Mutharika's policies - especially Chief Kachindamoto (she's in the photo with me, she's formidable and has been nicknamed ""The Terminator""!). She gave me such a warm welcome today. She has implemented the annulment of so many child marriages and restored the futures of these girls. With the help and collaboration of her local chiefs, mothers' groups and religious leaders she has managed to annul almost 1500 child marriages, sending the girls back to school. President Mutharika has committed to make child marriage a thing of the past in Malawi within the next five years. It was amazing to be on the ground with UN Women and Chief Kachindamoto to witness their work!

You can watch the documentary (North America only, coming to UK in the Autumn...), learn more and make a donation via viceland.com/woman #BeAWitness x",#BeOurGuest,,,"Thank you Calvin Klein & Eco Age for collaborating with me and creating the most amazing gown. I am proud to say it is truly sustainable and represents a connection between myself and all the people in the supply chain who played a role in creating it. 

The body of the gown is crafted from three different fabrics, all woven from yarns made from recycled plastic bottles (!). Plastic is one of the biggest pollutants on the planet. Being able to repurpose this waste and incorporate it into my gown for the  #MetGala proves the power that creativity, technology and fashion can have by working together. 

Each and every part of this beautiful gown has been produced with sustainability in mind, even the components that you can't see. The zippers on the gown are made from recycled materials and the inner bustier has been crafted from organic cotton. Conventional cotton is one of the highest impact crops, using more chemicals than any other crop in the world. Organic cotton on the other hand, is grown without the use of the most harmful chemicals and is therefore better for the environment and people working with cotton. The organic silk used in the lining of my gown is certified to a standard that guarantees the highest environmental and social standards throughout production. It is my intention to repurpose elements of the gown for future use. The trousers can be worn on their own, as can the bustier, the train can be used for a future red carpet look… I'm looking forward to experimenting with this. Truly beautiful things should be worn again and again and again. #30wears

Ended up on noses too.. not just foreheads. #unicef #EndViolence #bindibonding #thistimeforafrica,"Loyd ( in the red t shirt) wants to be a musician. He has an incredible voice and is currently finishing a song he's composed called""I'm not shy of my status"" thandiwe( the girl in the blue t who wants to be a psychologist ) and Tendai(in the checked t who wants to be an EMT) both had stories that made my heart break over and over again.. these young kids are so brave to have accepted their HIV status and know that they can live a wholesome life instead of giving up..AFRICAID is an inspirational organization that provides specialist services to children to be safe. This incredible group of CATS( community adolescent treatment supporters) who themselves are young children and adults living with HIV.. support HIV positive kids and families with knowledge skills and how to deal with the stigma of living with HIV. #unicef and #AFRICAID have partnered to do so much good work. I'm so moved and privileged to have spent so much time with them and the care workers. 🙏🏻 keep inspiring the world..
Ps. I didn't post a pic with the faces of the group since a lot of them wanted their identity concealed because of the stigma they may face.","Amazing women who are champions of change.. they are a peer group that empowers boys and girls of their age to cope with social and economic pressures that leads to violence, unwanted pregnancies and child marriages. This club is adolescent-led, adolescent-driven and adult mentored. So inspiring to see these girls taking charge of their lives and their communities . Thank you.. 🙏🏻 for including me",We cannot keep ignoring what is happening to our children around the world. My experience in Zimbabwe is a huge example of how the world is so desensitized to the plight of women and children. Mind sets need to change. It is not her fault!! She is not a commodity. Protect our children...they are the Future. UNICEF #EndViolence,"This is what survivors of sexual violence look like. Not Victims! We can't name the girls to protect their identity, but their stories of resilience are so inspiring.. thank u for sharing with me #EndViolence #thistimeforafrica #bindibonding UNICEF",Follow my insta stories for live updates of my #Unicef trip in Zimbabwe.Violence against children is a violation to humanity. #EndViolence,"It's the end of a long day of travel from NYC to Harare but I'm not tired…. In fact, I'm energized, waiting for dawn to break so I can set out on the journey of discovery that these amazing women and men have laid out for me.  Meet Team UNICEF. Their passion and compassion is contagious and their hard work and dedication evident in everything I have just seen and heard in our meeting.

We are here in Harare Zimbabwe on a field visit in the first part of my trip to Africa as part of our efforts to #EndViolence against Children. I'm looking forward to tomorrow and the opportunity to meet the courageous young survivors, their amazing caregivers and the teams that wake up every day and try to make the world a better place… one child at a time.

I want to take you all on this journey with me, real time, and I hope you will join me here on these pages to bring awareness to some very important issues.  Like, share, comment… do something.  This is so very close to my heart, and know that every action (big or small) counts.

Nothing and no one should make you feel ""less"" just because you shed your tears. If anything, it makes you more beautiful. The beauty of imperfection. That is what makes you human. ------------------------------------------
One of my kids at the voice kids Indonesia cried while singing one of her favorite ballad songs (during rehearsal) I came to her and i asked what's wrong. She said, ""I miss my Dad."" She's been living with her Aunt after her Dad passed away. I knew then that I needed to remind her to not be afraid to cry and to never feel embarrassed of her emotions. A strong and brave girl who loves singing and wants to make her dream come true. ----------------------------------------------A lot of people are afraid to ""feel"" because people often associate ""feelings"" and emotions with weakness. NO. Cuz only strong and brave people dare to embrace and show their vulnerability. It makes us realize that there's sun after the rain; it teaches us how to be grateful and happy in good times and bad times. We learn to EMBRACE all situations thrown at us. ----------------------------------------------
Eygra, i love you and i pray so that you will stay pure. Your heart needs to be bare. When the world is trying to bring you down, learn to love and forgive. No walls should cover your beautiful heart. And let your pure heart shines brighter than ever... - AGNEZ MO ----------------------------------------------
James 1:2-4 NIV ""Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."" ----------------------------------------------Yakobus 1:2-4 ""Saudara-saudaraku, anggaplah sebagai suatu kebahagiaan, apabila kamu jatuh ke dalam berbagai-bagai pencobaan sebab kamu tahu, bahwa ujian terhadap imanmu itu menghasilkan ketekunan. Dan biarkanlah ketekunan itu memperoleh buah yang matang, supaya kamu menjadi sempurna dan utuh dan tak kekurangan suatu apapun.""

If you remember, I shared an oath of love called I AM GENERATION OF LOVE. Today i am humbled and honored to announce that on Sept 20, 2015, International Day of Peace, in our Town Hall (DKI Jakarta), I AM GENERATION OF LOVE that I wrote will be billed as Peace Movement Declaration. This event will include the signing of commemorative plaque, on which my oath of love will be in-scripted, by me, Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok) and former First Lady Sinta Nuriyah Wahid (representative of Wahid Institute). In this event, I will read out this I AM GENERATION OF LOVE by AGNEZ MO (Peace Movement Declaration) along with thousands of attendees as a step to become a part of Generation of Love. ---------------------------------------------------Ini mungkin adalah prestasi yang paling besar dan saya banggakam dalam hidup saya. Kalau kalian ingat, beberapa saat yang lalu, saya sempat menulis Oath of Love berjudul I AM GENERATION OF LOVE. Hari ini saya ingin membagikan kabar baik untuk kalian. Saya merasa sangat berterima kasih bahwa pada tanggal 20 September 2015, dalam perayaan International Day of Peace, di Balai Kota DKI Jakarta, I AM GENERATION OF LOVE yang saya tulis akan menjadi naskah Peace Movement Declaration. Dalam acara ini, saya akan memimpin para peserta acara membacakan I AM GENERATION OF LOVE sebagai Peace Movement Declaration, menyuarakan perubahan yang dimulai dari diri sendiri (to love and to forgive) untuk perdamaian dunia yang lebih baik. Setelah itu, plakat I AM GENERATION OF LOVE, akan ditandatangani oleh saya sendiri, Gubernur kita Pak Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok), dan Ibu Sinta Nuriyah Wahid (sebagai pemimpin Wahid Institute), sebagai tanda bahwa kami adalah bagian dari Generation of Love.",Interesting is happening with i #AMgenerationOfLOVE campaign that i started and the Oath of Love that i wrote a few weeks ago.

This girl is one of my most favorite song writers and has always been one that i adore. A DOPE SONG WRITER !! Check out ""Makeba Riddick"". I remember i used to dream to work with her and now she's part of my team. Not only that, she believes in me and she's been doing the extra mile to make sure she can be there to write with me and for me. Thank you girl!!! 😘 I believe that this is God's favor. When we met for the first time, she told me that she heard my interview on Power 106 LA and she has been looking for me ever since. Isn't that just crazy?? The woman i had been wanting to work with was looking for me to work with me? 😧 Seriously if that is not God's favor... i dont know what it is. Well anyways, this HUMBLES me. Letting God taking the wheel and let him in control. Be faithful involves working and walking towards ur goal with faith, but it also involves being ""still"" allowing and letting God taking control; there are some things that we can't control and often we get frustrated by the situation and feeling weak. But I know I'm the ""strongest"" when im weak --> 2 Corinthians 12:9-11 New International Version (NIV)

But he said to me, ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."" Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

Thank You Father for bringing me the people I need in my life, thank You for believing me and taking care of me cuz I'm Your daughter.

Thank You Lord Jesus for teaching me how to be faithful in small and big things; and to never underestimate or belittle ANYTHING.
Thank You to never look at us like we don't matter. 
Thank You for treating us like we're worthy of Your love and Your mercy. You never look at us SMALL. 
You never look at our problems too small to ""talk""about. 
Thank You for allowing us to come to you, pray, and talk to you about ANYTHING. 
Thank You for listening to our ""Small things"" and our ""Big things"". Everything matters to you. 

How can I not love You, Lord... You're my Father, my Lord, my Bestfriend, my role model... ❤️❤️❤️❤️

How grateful I am to be Your child... Words can't describe how much I love You and how much I need You. I can only do this through You. ☺️☺️😍❤️
You are my rock! 

LUKE 16:10 NIV ""Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much."" 

LUKE 16:10 (NLT) ""If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won't be honest with greater responsibilities."" 

LUKAS 16:10 ""Barangsiapa setia dalam perkara-perkara kecil, ia setia juga dalam perkara-perkara besar. Dan barangsiapa tidak benar dalam perkara-perkara kecil, ia tidak benar juga dalam perkara-perkara besar.""",Tell Wright Entertainment Group who you're proud to be a fan of!!! 😘😘😘,"The couple who inspires me. Thanks for showing me & being the reason why I believe that a relationship can be faithful, beautiful & respectful; that people can still be loyal to each other. 

My brother, Steve, and my sister in law, Theresia, you are more than a brother and a sister to me. You are an inspiration to all of us. I know all the happy moments AND the struggles that u both have gone through; both of u CHOOSE to keep holding hands, being loyal to each other, and doing the right thing NO MATTER WHAT. Two wrongs don't make a right. That's a trait we don't see too often anymore and that I still believe in. You show me that your fear of God and doing what's right in His eyes make you not only a better person, but a better partner for each other.
You might not know this, but your love story have inspired a LOT OF people (me included). ☺️

Ko Steve, you're the best brother anyone could ever want. You show me that good things never come easy. By being loyal and respectful to your partner, by putting in the EFFORT and SACRIFICES in your relationship, you show me a whole lot more than just how to be a good partner; you show me how to be a great person. You do what it takes and go the extra mile to be a great boyfriend when u guys were still dating, to be a great man for her when u're married, a great Dad for Chloe, a great son for our mom, & a great brother for me. Being an example for all of us that it is possible. ☺️

You show me that A LOT OF TIMES, being sensitive to each other, choosing the right word & the right time, being honest & open, putting the effort & sacrifices, are more important than simply ""being in love"". Being in love is easy, being in a great relationship is not. It takes effort and two people who really want to make it work.

Thank you for showing me that being honest and open are things that we're responsible to do first, BEFORE asking for  trust. Do our responsibility first before asking for your ""right"" (It's funny how a lot of people do the opposite: asking for their right first before doin the work).
Thank you for being a figure that I can look up to. 🙌 for being a man of God everytime, everyday, everywhere. U ROCK FOR THAT!

Oh wow. 🙈 i just wrote a long page. But honestly, a whole book won't be enough to show you how grateful I am to have you both. 
I love you both so much. God bless you. 
Please remember that both of u are huge influences in my life! ❤️☺️","LEG DAY ERRRRDAY!!! 😘😘😘

Quando recebemos o diagnóstico do nosso filho perdemos o chão, foi como se tudo que tínhamos idealizado, sonhado durante a gravidez fosse embora com as palavras DOENÇA RARA E SEM CURA. 
Atrofia Muscular Espinhal, AME .
E nós estamos fazendo isso, AMANDO. Com o tempo todo nosso desespero se transformou em uma força que nem sabíamos que existia, e hoje somos uma família, a família #amejoaquim 🙏🏼 Essa linda mensagem do ator @rodrigosantoro nos emocionou muito, NOSSA CORRENTE PELA VIDA DO JOAQUIM GANHOU UNIÃO.
