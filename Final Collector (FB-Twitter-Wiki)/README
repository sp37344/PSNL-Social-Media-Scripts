DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program generates separate csv files for 3 different social media platforms:

csv is of the following format:

GENERAL USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run program, go to terminal and enter folder where program is stored. 

Folder contains an edited top100_users.csv, which lists the top 100 social 
media users based on Twitter. You can generate this file again if you uncomment
#get_top_100() in the main function of fb_twitter_wiki_collector.py.
WARNING: this will return an unrefined/unedited csv file that may 
contain incorrect usernames or empty names because the webpage that was scraped
is not updated. Thus, it is recommended to not alter the top100_users.csv file. 

Program requires Python 3. 

To run command: 
 -- python fb_twitter_wiki_collector.py

Output files are Facebook.csv, Twitter.csv, and Wikipedia.csv.
