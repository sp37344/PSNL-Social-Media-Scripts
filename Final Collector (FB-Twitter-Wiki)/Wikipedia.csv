After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.","Perry rose to fame in 2008 with the release of the singles ""I Kissed a Girl""—which sparked controversy for its sapphic themes—and ""Hot n Cold"" from her second album, a pop rock record titled One of the Boys.

Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years.[2][8] Her family struggled financially,[9] sometimes using food stamps and eating from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents' church.[10]","Growing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat Lucky Charms as the term ""luck"" reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs ""angeled eggs"".[11] Perry primarily listened to gospel music,[12] as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends.[13] While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, ""I pray all the time – for self-control, for humility.""[14] Following her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who suggested she take vocal lessons. She began training at age 9,[15] and was incorporated into her parents' ministry,[3] singing in church from ages 9 to 17.[16] At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday,[3][17] and publicly performed songs she wrote.[9] She tried to ""be a bit like the typical Californian girl"" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence.[18] She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.[19]","During her freshman year of high school,[20] Perry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15, and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career. She briefly studied Italian opera at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills.[21][22] In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar.[12] After signing with Red Hill Records, Perry recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled Katy Hudson. She released the album on March 6, 2001, and went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour.[23][24] while also embarking on other performances of her own in the United States.[25] Katy Hudson received positive reviews from critics, though was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December.[26][27] Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard,[28] and moved to Los Angeles at age 17.[29] In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry, using her mother's maiden name.[30]","In 2004, Perry signed to Ballard's label, Java, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group. She began work on a solo record, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped.[31] Ballard then introduced Perry to Tim Devine, an A&R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. Over the course of the next two years, Perry wrote and recorded material for her Columbia debut, and worked with songwriters including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler/Anne Previn, The Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, and Max Martin and Dr. Luke.[32][33] In addition, after Devine suggested they become a ""real group"", she recorded with the Matrix.[34] Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as her record neared completion. After the label dropped her, she worked at an independent A&R company called Taxi Music.[35]","Perry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, ""Simple"", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.[36] She provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song ""Old Habits Die Hard"",[37] which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie.[38] In September 2004, Blender named Perry ""The Next Big Thing"".[36] She recorded background vocals on P.O.D.'s single ""Goodbye for Now"" and was featured at the end of its music video in 2006. That year, Perry also appeared in the music video for ""Learn to Fly"" by Carbon Leaf, and played the love interest of her then-boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy, in the band's music video for ""Cupid's Chokehold"".[39]","After Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke in order to add an ""undeniable smash"" to her existing material.[40][41] Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to ""Ur So Gay"", aimed at introducing her to the music market.[42] A digital EP led by ""Ur So Gay"" was later released to create interest.[3][43] Madonna helped publicize the song by praising the track on the JohnJay & Rich radio show in April 2008,[44] stating it was her ""favorite song"".[45] In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode ""Life's Too Short"",[46] and appeared as herself during a photo shoot in June on The Young and the Restless for the show's magazine Restless Style.[47]","Perry released her first single with Capitol, ""I Kissed a Girl"", on April 28, 2008,[48] as the lead single from One of the Boys.

The former criticized its homosexual themes while the latter accused her of using bi-curiosity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success.[74] After her relationship with McCoy ended in December 2008,[75] Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek. Her scene, in which the two kiss, does not appear in the film.[76] She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[77] The couple became engaged on December 31, 2009, while vacationing in Rajasthan, India.[78]","After serving as a guest judge on American Idol,[79] Perry released ""California Gurls"" featuring rapper Snoop Dogg on May 7, 2010.[80] The song was the lead single from her third studio album, Teenage Dream, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in June.[81][82] She also served as a guest judge on The X Factor UK later that month[83] before releasing the album's second single, ""Teenage Dream"", in July.[84] ""Teenage Dream"" reached number one on Billboard in September.[85] Released on August 24, 2010,[86] the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.[87] It received mixed reviews from music critics,[88] and has since sold 6 million copies globally.[89] Teenage Dream would go on to win the 2011 Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[90] In October, ""Firework"" was released as the album's third single.[91] It became the album's third consecutive number one on the Hot 100 on December 8, 2010.[92]","A remixed version of ""E.T."" featuring rapper Kanye West was released as the fourth single from Teenage Dream on February 16, 2011.[93] It topped the Hot 100 chart for five non-consecutive weeks, making Teenage Dream the ninth album in history to produce four number one singles on the Hot 100.[94] ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" followed as the fifth single in June,[95] and Perry became the first female artist to achieve five number-one Hot 100 songs from one album when the single topped that chart on August 17, and the second artist after Michael Jackson with his album Bad.[96] For this record, she received an honorary American Music Award in November 2011[97] and a 2013 Guinness World Record.[98] On September 7, she set a new record by becoming the first artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100.[99] In October, ""The One That Got Away"" was released as the album's sixth single.[100] The song peaked at number three on the Hot 100[101] and number two in Canada.[56] On February 13, 2012, Capitol released the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, ""Part of Me"", which debuted at number one on the Hot 100 and became Perry's seventh single overall to top the chart.[54][102] Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was released on March 23.[103] ""Wide Awake"" was released on May 22 as the re-release's second single,[104] peaking at number two on the Hot 100[101] and number one in Canada[56] and New Zealand.[105] On January 5, she was named the sixth best-selling digital artist in the United States, with sales of 37.6 million units according to Nielsen SoundScan.[106] That month, she became the first artist to have four songs sell over 5 million digital units.[107]","Perry embarked on her second tour, the California Dreams Tour, in support of Teenage Dream[65] from February 2011 to January 2012.[108] The tour grossed $59.5 million globally[109] and won her the award for Best Live Act at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards.[110] On September 23, 2011, she performed on the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John and Rihanna.[111] In September 2010, Perry was scheduled to appear on the 41st-season premiere of Sesame Street.

Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke.[204] Perry intends to become ""more of a Joni Mitchell"", releasing folk and acoustic music.[205] Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was largely influenced by Madonna: Truth or Dare. She admires Madonna's ability to reinvent herself, saying ""I want to evolve like Madonna"",[206] and has credited Madonna for inspiring her to make Prism ""darker"" than her previous material.[207]","Perry names Björk as an influence, particularly admiring her ""willingness to always be taking chances"".[204] Other musicians who Perry has cited as influences include ABBA, The Cardigans,[208] Cyndi Lauper,[209] Ace of Base, 3OH!3,[210] CeCe Peniston, C+C Music Factory, Black Box, Crystal Waters, Mariah Carey,[205] Heart, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Imogen Heap, Rufus Wainwright,[211] Pink,[212] and Gwen Stefani.[204] ""Firework"" was inspired by a passage in the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac in which the author compares people who are full of life to fireworks that shoot across the sky and make people watch in awe.[213] Her second concert tour, the California Dreams Tour, was reminiscent of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.[214] She also credits the 1996 movie The Craft for inspiring her song ""Dark Horse"",[215] and Eckhart Tolle's book The Power of Now for influencing Prism.[137]","""When I am in between records, sometimes I doubt myself. I'll be like 'Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate the world into thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position?' And then I go back into the studio and I start writing, and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes.""","While Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve themes of sex and love. One of the Boys is a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences.[217][218] Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life.[219] Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on love between teenagers; W described the album's sexual innuendos as ""irresistible hook-laden melodies"".[29] Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.[220]","Perry describes herself as a ""singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star""[221] and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her.

The tour started in Seattle, Washington on March 9, 2016.[109]","On July 22, 2016, Bieber released a new single with Major Lazer and MØ titled ""Cold Water"". It debuted at number two, on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Bieber's third number-two debut on the chart, passing Mariah Carey's record to become the artist with the most number-two debuts; he also leads with the most top-two debuts at five.[110] In August 2016, French DJ DJ Snake and Bieber released their collaborative song ""Let Me Love You"".[111] He appears in the documentary Bodyguards: Secret Lives from the Watchtower.[112]","On April 16, 2017, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee released a remix for their song Despacito featuring Justin Bieber.

[114] In the same month, DJ Khaled released a new music Video called ""I'm the One"" on his YouTube Channel feat. Quavo, Chance the Rapper, Lil Wayne and Justin Bieber.[115]","Bieber's music is mainly pop, while he also incorporates elements of R&B. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone asserted that the content of his music was ""offering a gentle introduction to the mysteries and heartaches of adolescence: songs flushed with romance but notably free of sex itself.""[116] After his hit in 2015 on Jack Ü's track Where R Ü Now, Bieber released the EDM-fueled album Purpose a collaboration with Diplo, DJ Snake and Major Lazer.[117]","Bieber has cited The Beatles, Boyz II Men, Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake, and Usher as his musical inspirations.[118][119][120] Bieber stated My World 2.0 was influenced by Timberlake.[121]","Bieber initially began singing with his adolescent voice, before later experiencing pubertal changes during a performance of ""Pray"" at the 2011 American Music Awards. Bieber started to receive vocal conditioning from coach Jan Smith. Sean Michaels of The Guardian described it as ""the biggest threat to his career"" at the time.[122] Jody Rosen commented that Bieber sings with ""swing and rhythmic dexterity"" on his debut, noting his tone to be ""nasal"".[116]","In a review of his Purpose album, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph complimented his ""soft, supple and seductive singing"".[123] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian also praised Bieber’s ""affectedly breathy voice"", but insisted in the same sentence that ""the voice soon palls"" after listening to the whole album.[124]","Usher commented that while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, ""I had the chance to ramp up my success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly"". As a result, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coach him on handling fame and his public image.[20] After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's road manager and stylist. Good, once nicknamed Bieber's ""swagger coach"", created a ""streetwise look"" for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of The Los Angeles Times comments, ""Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber's manner of dress and speech ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's like, you know, whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favourite rappers.""[125] In 2013, Bieber said that he was ""very influenced by black culture"", but he neither thought ""of it as black or white"" nor tried to ""act or pose in a certain way"". To him, it was ""a lifestyle—like a suaveness or a swag"".[126] Wax statues of him with his hairstyle from that of his earlier career are on display at the Madame Tussauds wax museums in Amsterdam, London, and New York City.[127]","""He's the only person in humanity who's grown up the way he has -- with smartphones and cameras on him 24/7 ... Another kid can go out and have a good night on the town, and no one gives a crap, but Justin is the most Googled person on the planet -- for four years straight!""","Bieber is often featured in teen magazines, such as Tiger Beat,[20] and has been labelled as a ""teen heartthrob"".[128] In 2010, he was frequently criticized for looking and sounding younger than his age,[129] and the following year for an androgynous appearance, which had been commonly noted in the media, including his appearance on the cover of LOVE magazine's androgyny issue in 2011.[130] His teen-pop music, image (especially as a heartthrob to young teenage girls), and the media attention he receives have additionally been criticized.[129] He has been a target of Internet bloggers and message board posters, especially users of the Internet message board 4chan and of YouTube.[131] Nick Collins of The Daily Telegraph said that ""Bieber's character appears to strike a particularly sour note with his Internet critics"" who have questioned his manner of speech, among other things.[129]","Bieber's early fanbase developed on YouTube and predated the release of his first album (My World).[132] According to Jan Hoffman of The New York Times, part of Bieber's appeal stems from his YouTube channel. Chicago Tribune noted that Bieber's fanbase, ""Beliebers"", was among the top words of 2010.[133] Long before the November 2009 release of My World, his YouTube videos attracted millions of views.[20] Braun recognized the appeal. Before flying him to Atlanta, Braun wanted to ""build him up more on YouTube first"" and had Bieber record more home videos for the channel. ""I said: 'Justin, sing like there’s no one in the room. But let's not use expensive cameras.' We'll give it to kids, let them do the work, so that they feel like it's theirs"", recalled Braun.[20] Bieber continues to upload videos to the same channel and has opened a Twitter account, from which he interacts with fans regularly;[25] his account was reported in November 2010 to have more than six million followers.[134] Bieber surpassed Lady Gaga for having the most followed person on Twitter in January 2013. In early November 2013, Katy Perry surpassed him for having the most followers.[135] As of 2017, Bieber remains the second most followed user of Twitter, while his VEVO channel makes him the third most subscribed user of YouTube.","Bieber was frequently a trending topic on Twitter when the feature first launched[136] because his fans frequently discussed him on the network,[137] and he was named the top trending star on Twitter in 2010;[138] Klout gave his account a score of 100.[139][140] In April 2013, the social media analysis company Socialbakers concluded that 16.7 million of Bieber's 37 million Twitter followers are not genuine.[141][142]","Bieber has described himself as a faithful adherent of Christianity, said he communicates with God via prayer, and that ""he's the reason I'm here"".[143] He reflected his faith in a music video with Brandon Burke, titled ""#iPledge"", in which he ""talks candidly about his appreciation for the tenet of forgiveness in the Christian faith"".[144] According to Scooter Braun, he has also stated that he regularly cites the Jewish prayer Shema Yisrael before every live show showcasing his view on multiculturalism.[145]","Bieber dated Selena Gomez from December 2010 to November 2012.[146][147][148][149] Regarding sexual abstinence, he told music magazine Rolling Stone, ""I don't think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them."" He added that he does not ""believe in abortion"", and that it is ""like killing a baby""; when asked about the case of abortion with regard to rape, however, he said, ""I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that.""[150][151] His view on sexual orientation is quoted as ""everyone's own decision"",[152] and he has contributed to the It Gets Better Project,[153] a non-profit group aiming to prevent suicide among LGBT youth.[154]","As Bieber resides in the United States, he is reported to possess an O-1 visa for temporary resident status, based on ""extraordinary ability or achievement"" in a field.[155] Bieber has stated that he is not interested in obtaining US citizenship because of his view on America's market-oriented health care system. He has praised Canada as being ""the best country in the world"" citing its government-run health care system as a model example.[150]","Bieber's father, Jeremy Bieber, is a former carpenter and pro-am mixed martial artist. In March 2014, Rolling Stone characterized Jeremy as having ""split with Justin's mom when Justin was a toddler, and wasn't always around afterward. But he has, as of late, accepted a place of honor in his superstar son's entourage"".[156]","Aside from his career as a musician, Bieber has ventured into the worlds of business and philanthropy.","Bieber endorsed Adidas, beside Derrick Rose and Venus Williams, in 2012.[157] He became the new ""face"" and ""body"" of Calvin Klein in early 2015.[158] In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington.[159] He has bandwagoned four fragrances as of 2014.[160] He launched his debut fragrance, Someday, in 2011;[160] it grossed more than three million US dollars in sales, at Macy's, in just under three weeks, which industry experts regard as a successful celebrity-led launch.[161] On the heels of that 2011 best-seller, he launched his second fragrance, Girlfriend, in June 2012.[162] His third fragrance, The Key, was launched in July 2013,[163] and his latest fragrance, Justin Bieber Collector's Edition, launched in 2014.[164]","Bieber supports Pencils of Promise,[165] a charity founded by Adam Braun, the younger brother of Bieber's manager.

Although the number of signatures received was sufficient to require a response under published White House guidelines; it has been noted that the Obama Administration has declined substantive comment on the petition.[184] Immigration Law expert Harlan York noted that the likeliness of Bieber being deported was extremely slim. York stated, ""About a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that driving under the influence, typically, is not a basis to deport someone.""[185]","On July 9, 2014, Bieber was charged with one misdemeanour count of vandalism in California for throwing eggs at his Calabasas neighbour's home in January.[177][186][187] Police earlier claimed that they had video footage of him high-fiving friends after the eggs were thrown.[177][188] With him pleading no contest to the charge, the Los Angeles County Superior Court sentenced him on July 9 to pay US$80,900 in restitution, serve two years' probation, complete twelve weeks of anger management, and five days of community service in what the district attorney termed a negotiated settlement.

He is the first African American to have served as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004.","Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. He grew up mostly in Hawaii, but also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.","During his first two years in office, Obama signed many landmark bills. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as ""Obamacare""), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the U.S.-Russian New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.","After winning re-election by defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama also advocated gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated the sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.","Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.[3][4] He currently resides in Washington, D.C. His presidential library will be built in Chicago.","Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[5] at Kapiʻolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii.[6][7][8] He is the only President to have been born in Hawaii.[9] He was born to a white mother and a black father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, of mostly English descent,[10] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[11] His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982), was a married Luo Kenyan man from Nyang'oma Kogelo. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on scholarship.[12][13] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[14][15]","In late August 1961, Obama's mother moved with him to the University of Washington in Seattle for a year. During that time, Obama Sr. completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii in June 1962, then left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[16] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, in 1971,[17] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[18] Of his early childhood, Obama recalled, ""That my father looked nothing like the people around me – that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk – barely registered in my mind.""[13] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[19]","In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography at the University of Hawaii, and the couple were married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[20] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966, followed sixteen months later by his wife and stepson in 1967, with the family initially living in a Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet subdistrict of south Jakarta, then from 1970 in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng subdistrict of central Jakarta.[21]","From ages six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi) Catholic School for two years and Besuki Public School for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[22][23] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him ""a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works"".[24]","Obama returned to Honolulu in 1971 to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School— a private college preparatory school— with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until his graduation from high school in 1979.[25] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname ""Barry"".[26] Obama lived with his mother and sister in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[27] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[28] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian cancer and uterine cancer.[29]","Reflecting later on his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: ""The opportunity that Hawaii offered – to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect – became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.""[30] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to ""push questions of who I was out of my mind"".[31] Obama was also a member of the ""choom gang"", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[32][33]","After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid.[34] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks.[34] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[35] and in English literature[36] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[37] He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for a year at the Business International Corporation,[38] then at the New York Public Interest Research Group.[39][40] In 1985, Obama was among the leaders of May Day efforts to bring attention to the New York City Subway system, which was in a bad condition at the time. Obama traveled to several subway stations to get people to sign letters addressed to local officials and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and was photographed at the City College subway station holding a sign protesting against the system's condition.[41]","In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: ""It's like a little mini-United Nations"", he said.

Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[46] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.[47]","Besides his native English, Obama speaks some basic Indonesian, having learned the language during his four childhood years in Jakarta.[48][49] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team;[50] he is left-handed.[51]","Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[52] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[53] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President.[54] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[55]","In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin.[56] Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at several group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date.[57] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[58] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998,[59] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (""Sasha""), on June 10, 2001.[60] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools.

He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet ""in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known."" He described his father as a ""confirmed atheist"" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as ""a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand ""the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.""[78]","In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: ""I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.""[79] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying ""I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.""[80][81]","Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright in October 1987, and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[82] He resigned from Trinity in May 2008 during his first presidential campaign after some of Wright's statements were criticized.[83] The Obama family has attended several Protestant churches since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but are not habitual church-goers.[84][85][86]","Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama was hired in Chicago as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side.

The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[99]","In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[99][100] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[101]","From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of ""40 under Forty"" powers to be.[102]","He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004.

Ill.).[103] This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.[104] The case was settled out of court.[105] Final Judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.[106] His law license became inactive in 2007.[107][108]","From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago, which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project, and of the Joyce Foundation.[40] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[40]","Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[109] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[110] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[111] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[112]","He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was reelected again in 2002.[113] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[114]","In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[115] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[111][116] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[117] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[118]","In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race.

His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[128]","Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[129] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[130] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.[131]","Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[132] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[133] CQ Weekly characterized him as a ""loyal Democrat"" based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007.

The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[159] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[160]","On August 23, Obama announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.[161] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine.[162] At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.[163] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of over 75,000; the speech was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide.[164][165]","During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.[166] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.[167]","John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate.

Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[231] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.[232] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[233] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as ""Cash for Clunkers"", that temporarily boosted the economy.[234][235][236]","Spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion was spent by the end of November 2009.[237] Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5 trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9% of GDP.[238][239] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34 trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53 trillion or 90% of GDP.[240] The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2 trillion took effect in February 2014.[241] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.[242] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[243]","As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[246] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[247] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,[248] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.[249] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.[250] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.[251] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[251] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was ""unusually uncertain"".[252] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.[253]","The Congressional Budget Office and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.[254][255] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,[255][256][257][258] while conceding that ""It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.""[254] Although an April 2010 survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[259] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II.[260] The OECD credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus in the United States and the austerity measures in the European Union.[261]","Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[262] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[263]","In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a ""defining challenge of our time"" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[264]",Obama has urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[265],"On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming.[266][267]","On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[268] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[269]","In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and stated he ""would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution"" or ""greenhouse emissions"".[270][271] Obama's advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.[272] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would authorize the pipeline.[273] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.[274]","Obama has emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.[275]","Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[276] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[277][278]","On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[276] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[280] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[281]","On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[282][283] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.[284] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.[285] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[286]","The ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[287] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum ""out-of-pocket"" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,[288][289] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and Congressional Budget Office figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[288][290]","The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[292] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[293] In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.[294]","The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.[295] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that ""closely-held"" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans ""established by the State"", as the statute reads.[296]","Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based ""All of the above"" approach to domestic energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.[297] Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.[298][299]","On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[300] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[301] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.[302] In a 2016 editorial in the New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed ""common-sense gun reform"" to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history.[303]","Obama called the November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,[304] ""humbling"" and a ""shellacking"".[305] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.[306]","On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the Federal Communications Commission reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[307][308] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed Executive Order 13636, ""Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity"".[309]","In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a ""new era"" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms ""break"" and ""reset"" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[310] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab cable TV network, Al Arabiya.[311]","On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.[312][313] In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.[314] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for ""A New Beginning"" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[315]","On June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election by saying: ""The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.""[316] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded Vice President Biden's comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: ""We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.""[317]","On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to preside over a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.[318]","In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[319][320] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about one-third.[321] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[322]","In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[323] He criticized Russia's law discriminating against gays in August 2013,[324] stopping short of advocating a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, Russia.[325]","In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to normalize relationships between Cuba and the United States.[326] The countries' respective ""interests sections"" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.","In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a ""Joint Planning Cell"" with Saudi Arabia.[327]","Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been his ""closest international partner"" throughout his tenure as President.[328]","On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, ""Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.""[329] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[330][331] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[332] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be ""home for the holidays"".[333]","In June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by Daesh, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Daesh continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.[334][335]","In August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against Daesh.[336]","By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict[337] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.[338]","In the spring of 2015, with the addition of the ""Panther Brigade"" of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400,[339] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.[340]","Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.[341] He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to ""stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan"", an area he said had not received the ""strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires"".[342] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[343] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[344] this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[345] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.[346]","In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.[347]","In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[348] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[349]","In June 2011, Obama said that the bond between the United States and Israel is ""unbreakable"".[350] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[351] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[352]","In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, ""with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.""[353]","In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said that both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, ""To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.""[354] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[355]","On December 23, 2016 under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, effectively allowing it to pass.[356] Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized the Adminsitration's actions,[357][358] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million in United States dollars, on January 6, 2017.[359] On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.[360][361]","In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[362] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[363] In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to ""show no mercy"" to the rebels of Benghazi[364]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities,[365] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[366] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[367][368][369] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all of its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[370] Some Representatives[371] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[372][373]","On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: ""The time has come for President Assad to step aside.""[374][375] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[376] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[377] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[378][379]","In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the ""red line"" he had pledged[380] and, rather than authorise the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[381][382] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised that the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.[383][384]","Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad.[385] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[385] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a ""surgical raid"" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[385] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[386][387] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,[388] which was buried at sea several hours later.[389] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square.[386][390] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush,[391] and from many countries around the world.[392]","In November 2013, Obama's administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the ""Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"", saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[393][394][395]","Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City.[396] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.[397] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.[398]","In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.[399] Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be ""Obama's finest foreign policy achievement"".[400] On July 1, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana.[401] The countries' respective ""interests sections"" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.[402]","Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.[403]","Obama spoke in front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progresses made in education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans.[404][405] During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.[406]","On May 27, 2016, 2½ months before the 71st anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended World War II, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima, Japan.

She became the first woman, and fifth act overall, to win the first of these twice.[144]","Prior to 1989's release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans.[145] In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters.[146] In June 2015, Swift criticized Apple Music in an open letter for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog.[147] The following day, Apple announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period,[148] and Swift agreed to stream 1989 on the streaming service.[149] Swift's intellectual property rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to the singer and the 1989 era memes.[150]","In 2015, Swift performed ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Shake It Off"" with Paul McCartney at the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special after-party,[151] and joined Kenny Chesney to sing ""Big Star"" on the opening night of his Big Revival Tour in Nashville.[152] In March 2015, Swift started dating Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris.[153] By June 2015, the duo were ranked as the highest-paid celebrity couple over the past year by Forbes with combined earnings of over $146 million.[154] In August, Swift addressed her mother's cancer diagnosis, and encouraged others to get a medical checkup.[155] Before Swift and Harris announced the end of their relationship in June 2016,[156] the two co-wrote his song ""This Is What You Came For"", for which she was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[157] In October, she penned Little Big Town's ""Better Man"" for their seventh album, The Breaker.[158] Two months later, Swift and Zayn Malik released a single together called ""I Don't Wanna Live Forever"", for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017),[159] which reached number one in Sweden.[160]","One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing at church.[2] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: ""My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own"".[161] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[162] She also attributes her ""fascination with writing and storytelling"" to her mother.[163] Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music,[164] and was introduced to the genre by ""the great female country artists of the '90s""—Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks.[165][166] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[167] Hill was Swift's childhood role model: ""Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it"".[168] She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[169] The band's ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[170] Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette.[12] She believes Parton is ""an amazing example to every female songwriter out there"".[171] Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams,[172] Patty Griffin[173] and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.[21]","Swift lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson and Carly Simon as her career role models: ""They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers"".[21][174] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel ""as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that"".[175] She admires Springsteen for being ""so musically relevant after such a long period of time"".[176] She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: ""It's not about fame for her, it's about music"".[177] ""[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out"", Swift says.[178] She admires Simon's ""songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person"".[179]","Swift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has ""unwavering devotion"" for Spears.[180][181] In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional,[182] Fall Out Boy,[183] and Jimmy Eat World.[184] She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch,[184] Alanis Morissette,[185] Ashlee Simpson,[186] Fefe Dobson[184] and Justin Timberlake;[187] and the 1960s acts like The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys.[188] Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and ""Like a Prayer-era Madonna"".[189]","Swift's music contains elements of pop, pop rock and country.[190] She self-identified as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she described as a ""sonically cohesive pop album"".[191] Rolling Stone asserted, ""[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days"".[192] The New York Times noted, ""There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country—a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar—but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville"".[193] According to The Guardian, Swift ""cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory"".[194]","Swift's vocals have been described by Sophie Schillaci from The Hollywood Reporter as ""sweet, but soft"".[195] In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identified Swift's ""defining"" vocal gesture as ""the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy"".[196] Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: ""Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.""[197] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously ""bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean.""[198] The Hollywood Reporter opines that her live vocals are ""fine"", but they do not match those of her peers.[195] In 2009, they were also described as ""flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt"".[199] However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[200]","In an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: ""I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.""[21] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is ""not the best technical singer"", but described her as the ""best communicator that we've got"".[201] Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has ""put a lot of work"" into improving it.[202] It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.[203] She has said that she only feels nervous performing ""if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows"".[204]","Swift uses her life experiences as an inspiration in her work.[205] In her songs, Swift often addresses the ""anonymous crushes of her high school years"" and celebrities.[206] Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends,[207] an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: ""Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic.""[208] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to ""mine her personal life for music … is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers"".[209] The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual and that they are sometimes based on observations.[210] Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically ""because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus"".[211]","For a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated—a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way—that's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist.","The Guardian has praised Swift for writing about teenage years ""with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia"" over the course of her first two albums.[194] New York has remarked that many singer-songwriters have made great records as teens, but ""none made great records so explicitly about their teens"". The magazine has also compared her work to Brian Wilson.[213] In Fearless, Swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect ""between fairy tales and the reality of love"".[214] Her later albums address more adult relationships.[174] In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships, friendships,[215][216] alienation, fame, and career ambitions.[163] Swift frequently includes ""a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative"".[217]","Rolling Stone describes Swift as ""a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture"".[218] According to The Village Voice, she uses third-verse point of view reversals frequently.[217] In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting. In The Guardian's words, ""she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot"".[194] Slant Magazine adds, ""to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album"".[219] Although reviews of Swift's work are ""almost uniformly positive"", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed ""more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary"".[21]","Swift's personal life is the subject of constant media attention.[220] In 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a ""slut-shaming"" remark directed toward her.[221] The New York Times asserted that her ""dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash"" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a ""quarter-life crisis"".[222] Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public,[220] as she believes that talking about it can be ""a career weakness"".[223]","Rolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: ""If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.""[224] The magazine also takes note of her ""ease with glad-handing"",[31] and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as ""the Best People Person since Bill Clinton"".[225] While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who ""has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish"".[226] Swift considers Obama to be a role model.[227] Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans.[228][229] She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed ""Swiftmas"".[230] She considers it her ""responsibility"" to be conscious of her influence on young fans,[231] and has said that her fans are ""the longest and best relationship I have ever had"".[232]","Often described by the media as ""America's Sweetheart"",[233] Swift insists that ""I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free"". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots,[234] although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol.[235] Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.[236] In 2014 she topped People's annual best dressed list.[237] In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards,[238] and ranked first in Maxim's Hot 100 list.[239]","Swift has also appeared in various power listings.

Rihanna,"Robyn Rihanna Fenty (/riˈænə/;[1] born February 20, 1988) is a Barbadian singer, songwriter, and actress. Born in Saint Michael and raised in Bridgetown, she first entered the music industry by recording demo tapes under the direction of record producer Evan Rogers in 2003. She ultimately signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings after auditioning for its then-president, hip hop producer and rapper Jay Z. In 2005, Rihanna rose to fame with the release of her debut studio album Music of the Sun and its follow-up A Girl like Me (2006), which charted on the top 10 of the US Billboard 200 and respectively produced the singles ""Pon de Replay"" and ""SOS"".","She assumed creative control for her third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007) and adopted a public image as a sex symbol while reinventing her music. Its successful lead single ""Umbrella"" became an international breakthrough in her career, as she won her first Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration with Jay Z in 2008. After releasing four consecutive platinum studio albums, including the Grammy Award winner Unapologetic (2012), she was recognized as a pop icon. Her eighth studio album Anti (2016) and its lead single ""Work"" reached number-one on the Billboard 200 and Hot 100.

Rihanna is the youngest and fastest solo artist to earn fourteen number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, and was named the Digital Songs Artist of the 2000s decade and the top Hot 100 artist of the 2010s decade by Billboard.[3][4][5] Among numerous awards and accolades, Rihanna has won eight Grammy Awards, twelve American Music Awards, twelve Billboard Music Awards and the inaugural Icon Award at the American Music Awards of 2013. Widely recognized for frequently reinventing her style, she received the Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 2014. Forbes ranked Rihanna the fourth most powerful celebrity of 2012, and was named one of Time's ""100 Most Influential People in the World"" later that year.[6]",,,"Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988,[7] in Saint Michael, Barbados. Her mother, Monica (Braithwaite), is a retired accountant of Afro-Guyanese background, and her father, Ronald Fenty, is a warehouse supervisor of Afro-Barbadian and Irish descent.[8][9] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships.[10][11] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Rihanna's childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to crack cocaine and alcohol which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. As a child, she went through a lot of CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered: ""[The doctors] even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense.""[10] By the time she was fourteen, Rihanna's parents had divorced and her health began to improve.[9][12] Rihanna grew up listening to reggae music and began singing at around the age of seven.[10][13] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere High School, where she studied alongside future England cricketer Chris Jordan and future West Indies cricketer Kraigg Brathwaite.[10] Rihanna was an army cadet in a sub-military programme; the singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[14] Although she initially wanted to graduate from high school, she chose to pursue a musical career instead.[15]","In 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates.[10] She was discovered in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers. Without a name or any material, the girl group managed to land an audition with Rogers who commented, ""The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist"".[10] Rihanna went to Rogers' hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's ""Emotion"" and Mariah Carey's ""Hero"".[16] Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with her mother present, and then invited her to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes which could be sent to record labels.[16] She recorded the demo over the next year intermittently, due to only being able to record during school holidays. ""Pon de Replay"" and ""The Last Time"" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album Music of the Sun.[17][18] That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers' and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.[16]","Rihanna's demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay Z, who had recently been appointed as president and Chief executive officer (CEO) of Def Jam.[19] When Jay Z first heard the track ""Pon de Replay"", he felt the song was too big for her, saying ""when a song is that big, it's hard [for a new artist] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists"".[20] Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York, where Jay Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio ""L.A."" Reid.[16][21] At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston's cover of ""For the Love of You"" (1987), as well as the demo tracks ""Pon de Replay"" and ""The Last Time"".[16] Jay Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future hit single ""Pon de Replay"".[20] His boss L.A. Reid was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed.[22] Reid left it to Jay Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam.

It supports WebM files and also 3GP, allowing videos to be uploaded from mobile phones.[75]","Videos with progressive scanning or interlaced scanning can be uploaded, but for the best video quality, YouTube suggests interlaced videos be deinterlaced before uploading. All the video formats on YouTube use progressive scanning.[76] YouTube's statistics shows that interlaced videos are still being uploaded to YouTube, and there is no sign of that actually dwindling. YouTube attributes this to uploading of made-for-TV content.[77]","YouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320×240 pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263),[78][79] with mono MP3 audio.[80] In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP format on mobile phones.[81] In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480×360 pixels.[82] In November 2008, 720p HD support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9.[83] With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format. In November 2009, 1080p HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels.[84][85] In June 2015, support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels.[86] In November 2016, support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) or Perceptual Quantizer (PQ).[87] HDR video can be encoded with the Rec. 2020 color space.[88]","In June 2014, YouTube introduced videos playing at 60 frames per second, in order to reproduce video games with a frame rate comparable to high-end graphics cards.[89][90] The videos play back at a resolution of 720p or higher.[91] YouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ) and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the VP9 format with stereo Opus audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports Windows XP, then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead.[92]",Non-DASH,DASH (video only),DASH (audio only),Live streaming,"^ [1] itag is an undocumented parameter used internally by YouTube to differentiate between quality profiles.

The videos can be viewed in several different ways, including the common anaglyph (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect.[99][100][101] The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision.[102]","In January 2015, Google announced that 360° videos would be natively supported on YouTube. On March 13, 2015, YouTube enabled 360° videos which can be viewed from Google Cardboard, a virtual reality system. YouTube 360 can also be viewed from all other virtual reality headsets.[103]","On September 13, 2016, YouTube launched a public beta of Community, a social media-based feature that allows users to post text, images (including GIFs), live videos and others in a separate ""Community"" tab on their channel.[104] At the time of release, Vlogbrothers, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3 received the feature.[105]","YouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.[106] This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by or related to another user's video are able to make a ""video response"". On August 27, 2013, YouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature.[107] Embedding, rating, commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner.[108]","YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface.[109] A small number of videos, such as the weekly addresses by President Barack Obama, can be downloaded as MP4 files.[110] Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos.[111] In February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout.[112] In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos.[113] In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.[114] The default settings when uploading a video to YouTube will retain a copyright on the video for the uploader, but since July 2012, it has been possible to select a Creative Commons license as the default, allowing other users to reuse and remix the material if it is free of copyright.[115]","Most modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video.[116] Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.[117] Since June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone.[118] In July 2010, the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls.[119] The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform.[120][121] In September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system.[122] According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third most used app.[123]","A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.[124] In January 2009, YouTube launched ""YouTube for TV"", a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles.[125][126] In June 2009, YouTube XL was introduced, which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen.[127] YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live.[128] On November 15, 2012, Google launched an official app for the Wii, allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel.[129] An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5.[130] Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17, 2013,[131] and, in October 2014, the Sony PlayStation 4.[132]","On June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt was in Paris to launch the new localization system.[133] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 89 countries, one territory (Hong Kong) and a worldwide version.[134]","The YouTube interface suggests which local version should be chosen on the basis of the IP address of the user. In some cases, the message ""This video is not available in your country"" may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.[182] The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions, including Amharic, Albanian, Armenian, Bengali, Burmese, Khmer, Kyrgyz, Laotian, Mongolian, Persian and Uzbek, which do not have local channel versions.[183] Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and some material offensive to Muslims.[184][185] In October 2012, a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey, with the domain youtube.com.tr. The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law.[186] In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty collection agency PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009.[187] In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.[188]","YouTube Red is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to exclusive content, background and offline video playback on mobile devices, and access to the Google Play Music ""All Access"" service.[189] YouTube Red was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as ""Music Key"", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music ""All Access"" service.[190][191][192] On October 28, 2015, the service was re-launched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos, as well as access to exclusive original content.[193][194][195]","As of November 2016[update], the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[196]","On February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced the launch of YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for $35 per month. Initially launching in five major U.S. markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[197][198] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox Broadcasting Company and NBC), as well as approximately 40 cable channels owned by the corporate parents of those networks, The Walt Disney Company, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, and NBCUniversal (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN). Subscribers can also receive Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Red original content (YouTube TV does not include a YouTube Red subscription).[199][200]","Both private individuals[201] and large production companies[202] have used YouTube to grow audiences. Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[201] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings, and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.[202] YouTube channels launched by The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon became two of the most subscribed. While YouTube's revenue-sharing ""Partner Program"" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[203] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million (the most successful of whom were YouTubers PewDiePie, Smosh, and the Fine Brothers)[204]—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as ""a free-to-use... promotional platform for the music labels"".[205] In 2013 Forbes' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[206] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as ""mega"", ""mainstream"" and ""mid-sized"" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year,[207] as the Vevo channels of Justin Bieber and Rihanna became two of the top five most subscribed, and music videos outperformed other content in attracting the most views and the most likes, particularly in the cases of ""Gangnam Style"" in 2012 and ""See You Again"" in 2015. By early 2013 Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts.[208]","Observing that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been ""fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution"", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that ""what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication"".[209] Anderson asserted that it's not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch ""the biggest learning cycle in human history.""[209] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what Forbes'  Michael Noer called ""the largest school in the world"", with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[210] YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[211] the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that ""both embodies and promotes democracy.""[212] The Washington Post reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white.[213] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of ""visual journalism"", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.[214] The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.[215]","YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.[216] Describing the Arab Spring (2010- ), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using ""Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.""[217] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the ""Kony 2012"" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video ""will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.""[218]","Conversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012[221] and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance.[222] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare[223] but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the ""YouTube Generation"".[219] Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.[219]","Some YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as Innocence of Muslims (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[224] TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[209] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in The New York Times that such videos have ""surprising implications"" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[225]","The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers[226] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[227] selected their membership based on individual video performances.[209][227] Further, the cybercollaboration charity video ""We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)"" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[228] with The Tokyo Times noting the ""We Pray for You"" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.[229] The anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[230] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries.[231] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video ""My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm"", legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[232]","Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as ""not material"" in a regulatory filing.[233] In June 2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[234] In January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical U.S. citizen watching television.[26] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion.[235] In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to eMarketer,[235][236][237] others estimated 4.7 billion,[235] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising.[53] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[238] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix and Hulu.[53]","YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[239] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[240] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called ""Shows"". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[241][242] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of ""Shows"" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[243] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[244] which is available only to users in the US, Canada and the UK as of 2010.[245][246] The service offers over 6,000 films.[247]","In May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program, a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site.[248] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.[249] There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program.[250] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[251] Assuming pre-roll advertisements on half of videos, a YouTube partner would earn 0.5 X $7.60 X 55% = $2.09 per 1000 views in 2013.[251]","Much of YouTube's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos.[237] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue.[252] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[253] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators.[254][255][256]","YouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site's features. Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content, videos of animal abuse, shock videos, content uploaded without the copyright holder's consent, hate speech, spam, and predatory behavior.[257] Despite the guidelines, YouTube has faced criticism from news sources for content in violation of these guidelines.","At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws.[258] Despite this advice, there are still many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted.[259][260] Organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[261][262][263] Viacom, demanding $1 billion in damages, said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed ""an astounding 1.5 billion times"". YouTube responded by stating that it ""goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works"".[264]","During the same court battle, Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site. The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which called the court ruling ""a setback to privacy rights"".[265][266] In June 2010, Viacom's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment, with U.S. federal Judge Louis L. Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling.[267] On April 5, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reinstated the case, allowing Viacom's lawsuit against Google to be heard in court again.[268] On March 18, 2014, the lawsuit was settled after seven years with an undisclosed agreement.[269]","In August 2008, a US court ruled in Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz from Gallitzin, Pennsylvania, who had made a home video of her 13-month-old son dancing to Prince's song ""Let's Go Crazy"", and posted the 29-second video on YouTube.[270] In the case of Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[271] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor.[272]","In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users. The performance rights organization GEMA argued that YouTube had not done enough to prevent the uploading of German copyrighted music. YouTube responded by stating:","On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.[274]","In April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice. When a dispute occurs, the uploader of the video has to contact UMG.[275][276] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe ""fair use"" laws apply.[277]","In June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.[278] The system, which became known as Content ID,[279] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[280] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video. YouTube describes Content ID as ""very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File"".[280] Content ID accounts for over a third of the monetized views on YouTube.[281]","An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube, and concluded that while the system was ""surprisingly resilient"" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.[282] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[283] If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[284] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[285]","YouTube has also faced criticism over the offensive content in some of its videos. The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is prohibited by YouTube's terms of service.[257] Controversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.[286][287] YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's terms of service.[257] In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was ""unimpressed"" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that ""proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content"". YouTube responded by stating:","We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly.[288] (July 2008)","In October 2010, U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al-Awlaki.[289] YouTube pulled some of the videos in November 2010, stating they violated the site's guidelines.[290] In December 2010, YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content.[291]","YouTube's policies on ""advertiser-friendly content"" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language, sexual content, and ""controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown"", unless the content is ""usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain"".[292] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was ""censorship by a different name"". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had ""improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators.""[293][294][295]","In March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremism content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would ""be delivered in a safe and appropriate way"". The Guardian newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had ""begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear"".[296][297] In early-April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had actually been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[298][299]","On April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that in order to ""ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules"", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000 lifetime views, before they may join the Partner Program.[300]","Most videos enable users to leave comments, and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content. In 2006, Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling ""community and collaboration on a scale never seen before"", and added that YouTube ""harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred"".[301] The Guardian in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:","In September 2008, The Daily Telegraph commented that YouTube was ""notorious"" for ""some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet"", and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, ""a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts"".[303] The Huffington Post noted in April 2012 that finding comments on YouTube that appear ""offensive, stupid and crass"" to the ""vast majority"" of the people is hardly difficult.[304]","On November 6, 2013, Google implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.[305] The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.[306][307] In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question ""why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?"" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.[308] The official YouTube announcement[309] received 20,097 ""thumbs down"" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.[310] Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that ""Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos"" and ""Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system"". In the same article Melvin goes on to say:[311]","Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation. Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot? The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.","On July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.[312]","On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments.[313]","In December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. This was disputed by Billboard, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.[314][315] On August 5, 2015, YouTube removed the feature which caused a video's view count to freeze at ""301"" (later ""301+"") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[316] YouTube view counts now update in real time.[317]","As of September 2012, countries with standing national bans on YouTube include China, Iran, and Turkmenistan.","YouTube is blocked for a variety of reasons, including:[318]","In some countries, YouTube is completely blocked, either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries.

In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014, Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service ""to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms."" Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that ""while we wish that we had [a] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience.""[360][361][362][363] The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service.

Rosenthal.","DeGeneres's comedy career became the basis of the successful sitcom Ellen, named These Friends of Mine during its first season.

She auditioned for New York shows without success.[14][24] She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for ten years.[25][26] After high school, her mother encouraged her to apply for the Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21), a musical theater training conservatory at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.[14] One of 20 students to gain early admission, she, aged 17, lived in an NYU dorm on 11th Street.[23] In addition to sharpening her songwriting skills, she composed essays and analytical papers on art, religion, social issues, and politics, including a thesis on pop artists Spencer Tunick and Damien Hirst.[27][28] She also auditioned for various roles and won the part of an unsuspecting diner customer for MTV's Boiling Points, a prank reality television show.[14][29]","At age 19, Gaga withdrew from CAP21 during the second semester of her sophomore year, deciding to focus on her musical career.[30] In mid-2005, Gaga recorded a couple of songs with hip-hop singer Grandmaster Melle Mel, for an audio book accompanying Cricket Casey's children's book The Portal in the Park.[14][31] She also formed a band called the Stefani Germanotta Band (SGBand) with some friends from NYU.[14][23] The band played at gigs around New York becoming a local fixture of the downtown Lower East Side club scene.[23] After the 2006 Songwriters Hall of Fame New Songwriters Showcase at The Cutting Room in June, Gaga was recommended to music producer Rob Fusari by talent scout Wendy Starland.[32] Fusari collaborated with Gaga, who traveled daily to New Jersey, to work on songs she had written and to compose new material with him.[14] According to the producer, they began dating in May 2006, and he claimed to have created the ""Lady Gaga"" moniker after the Queen song ""Radio Ga Ga"".[33] The singer was in the process of trying to come up with a stage name when she received a text message from Fusari that read ""Lady Gaga"". He explained, ""Every day, when Stef came to the studio, instead of saying hello, I would start singing 'Radio Ga Ga'"". The text message was the result of a predictive text glitch that changed ""radio"" to ""lady"". Fusari said she texted back, ""That's it"", and declared, ""Don't ever call me Stefani again.""[34][35]","Fusari and Gaga established a company called Team Lovechild LLC to promote her career.[33] They recorded and produced electropop tracks and sent them to music industry executives.[36] Joshua Sarubin, the head of A&R at Def Jam Recordings, responded positively and after agreement from his boss, Antonio ""L.A."" Reid, Gaga was signed to Def Jam in September 2006.[14] However, she was dropped by the label after only three months – a period of her life that later inspired the music video of her 2011 single ""Marry the Night"".[37] Devastated, Gaga returned to the solace of the family home for Christmas and the nightlife culture of the Lower East Side. She became increasingly experimental: fascinating herself with emerging neo-burlesque shows, go-go dancing at bars dressed in little more than a bikini, in addition to experimenting with drugs.[38] Gaga explained her antics represented freedom: ""I went to a Catholic school but it was on the New York underground that I found myself.""[14][17][27] Her relationship with Fusari ended in January 2007 following which she became romantically involved with a heavy metal drummer. She compared this relationship and the subsequent breakup to the musical film Grease: ""I was his Sandy, and he was my Danny, and I just broke.""[39]","During this time, she met performance artist Lady Starlight, who helped mold her onstage persona.[40] Like SGBand, the pair soon began performing at many of the downtown club venues like the Mercury Lounge, The Bitter End, and the Rockwood Music Hall. Their live performance art piece was known as ""Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue"" and, billed as ""The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow"", was a low-fi tribute to 1970s variety acts.[41][42] Their performance at the 2007 Lollapalooza music festival[43] was critically acclaimed.[41]","Having initially focused on avant-garde electronic dance music, Gaga found her musical niche when she began to incorporate pop melodies and the glam rock of David Bowie and Queen into her music. While Gaga and Starlight were busy performing, Fusari continued to work on the songs he had created with Gaga. He sent these songs to his friend, producer and record executive Vincent Herbert.[44] The latter was quick to sign her to his label Streamline Records, an imprint of Interscope Records, established in 2007.[45] Gaga later credited Herbert as the man who discovered her, adding: ""I really feel like we made pop history, and we're gonna keep going.""[44] Having served as an apprentice songwriter during an internship at Famous Music Publishing, (later acquired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing), Gaga subsequently struck a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV. As a result, she was hired to write songs for Britney Spears and label mates New Kids on the Block, Fergie, and The Pussycat Dolls.[46] At Interscope, singer-songwriter Akon recognized her vocal abilities when she sang a reference vocal for one of his tracks in studio.[47] Akon then convinced Interscope Geffen A&M Chairman and CEO Jimmy Iovine to form a joint deal by having her also sign with his own label Kon Live, making her his ""franchise player"".[37][48]","Towards the end of 2007, Gaga met with songwriter and producer RedOne.[49] Gaga collaborated with him in the recording studio for a week on her debut album, and also joined the roster of Cherrytree Records, an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter Martin Kierszenbaum; she also wrote four songs with Kierszenbaum.[46] Despite her secure record deal, she admitted that there was fear about her being too ""racy"", ""dance-oriented"" and ""underground"" for the mainstream market. Her response: ""My name is Lady Gaga, I've been on the music scene for years, and I'm telling you, this is what's next.""[18]","By 2008, Gaga relocated to Los Angeles in order to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, The Fame, and set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga, modeled on Andy Warhol's Factory.[35][50] The Fame was released on August 19, 2008, with positive reception. Critics noted the album's combination of genres, ""from Def Leppard drums and hand claps to metal drums on urban tracks"", the inspiration drawn from 1980s synthpop and incorporation of dance music.[37] The Fame went to number one in Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK and appeared in the top five in Australia, the US and 15 other countries.[51][52] Its first two singles, ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face"", became worldwide commercial successes.[53][54][55] ""Poker Face"" won the award for Best Dance Recording at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards while The Fame won Best Dance/Electronica Album at the same ceremony.[56] Three other successful singles were released from the album—""Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)"", ""LoveGame"", and ""Paparazzi"".[54]","Following her opening act on The Pussycat Dolls' 2009 Doll Domination Tour in Europe and Oceania, Gaga embarked on her own worldwide The Fame Ball Tour, which ran from March to September 2009.[57] While she traveled the globe, Gaga released The Fame Monster, an EP of eight songs, in November 2009. Each song dealt with the darker side of fame from personal experience, expressed through a monster metaphor. Lead single ""Bad Romance"" topped the charts in 18 countries and reached number two in the US, Australia and New Zealand; it won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video.[58][59][60] Two other singles were released from the EP, ""Telephone"" (featuring Beyoncé) and ""Alejandro"". The former became Gaga's fourth UK number one single, while the latter faced controversy for its music video, which was deemed blasphemous by the Catholic League.[61][62] Despite the controversy surrounding her music videos, Gaga became the first artist to gain over one billion viral views on video-sharing website YouTube.[63] At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, Gaga won 8 of her 13 nominations, including Video of the Year for ""Bad Romance"".[64] As a result, she became the most nominated artist and the first female to receive two nominations for Video of the Year at a single ceremony.[65] In addition, The Fame Monster won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[66][67] Gaga also released, The Remix, which became her final record with Cherrytree Records.[68] With worldwide sales of 500,000, it remains among the best-selling remix albums of all time.[69] Forbes first listed Gaga on their 2010 Celebrity 100 and World's Most Powerful Women lists ranking her fourth and seventh, respectively.[70][71]","The success of The Fame and The Fame Monster allowed Gaga to start her second worldwide concert tour, The Monster Ball Tour, just weeks after finishing The Fame Ball Tour.[72] Critically and commercially successful, the tour began in November 2009 and ended in May 2011, and grossed $227.4 million, making it the highest-grossing for a debut headlining artist.[73][74] Concerts performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for an HBO television special titled Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden.[75] Gaga also performed songs from the albums at international events such as the 2009 Royal Variety Performance, 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, and the 2010 BRIT Awards.[76] Other performances might have included her participation in Michael Jackson's This Is It concert series at London's O2 Arena had he not died of a drug overdose. Gaga clarified that she was: ""actually asked to open for Michael on his tour... We were going to open for him at the O2 and we were working on making it happen. I believe there was some talk about us, lots of the openers, doing duets with Michael on stage.""[77]","During this era Gaga ventured into business, collaborating with consumer electronics company Monster Cable Products to create a pair of in-ear, jewel-encrusted, headphones titled Heartbeats. ""They are designed to be the first ever fashion accessories that double as the absolute best sonically sounding headphones in the world,"" she commented.[78] Gaga also partnered with Polaroid in January 2010 as their Creative Director and revealed a trio of new photo capturing products called Grey Label.[79][80] But her collaboration with past producer, and ex-boyfriend, Rob Fusari led to her production team, Mermaid Music LLC, being sued in March 2010 when he claimed that he was entitled to a 20% share of the company's earnings. The New York Supreme Court dismissed both the lawsuit and a countersuit by Gaga.[81][82] In addition to such strife, Gaga was tested borderline positive for lupus, but claimed not to be affected by the symptoms. The singer addressed the matter in an interview with Larry King, saying she hopes to avoid symptoms by maintaining a healthy lifestyle.[83][84]","In February 2011, Gaga released the lead single ""Born This Way"" from her studio album of the same name. The song debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the 1,000th number-one single in the history of the charts.[85][86] Its second single ""Judas"" also peaked within the top ten in several major musical markets, while ""The Edge of Glory"", first a commercial success in digital outlets, was later released as a single to rave critical reviews.[87][88] Born This Way, released on May 23, 2011, debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.108 million copies, and topped the charts in more than 20 other countries.[89] The album sold eight million copies worldwide, and received three Grammy Award nominations, including her third Album of the Year listing.[90] The album's following singles ""You and I"" and ""Marry the Night"" failed to match the international success.[91] In July 2011, she started dating actor and model Taylor Kinney, whom she met while filming the ""You and I"" music video.[92] The accompanying tour for Born This Way, titled the Born This Way Ball, began in April 2012 and concluded in February 2013. Some of the tour's shows were cancelled due to a labral tear of her right hip.[93][94] Shortly thereafter Gaga confirmed that she had hip surgery, and was recovering.[95] The tour earned $186.82 million globally.[96] Gaga was ranked as the second most-played artist of 2011 in the United Kingdom by the PPL.[97] She also topped the Celebrity 100 List, with earnings of $90 million, and was the highest ranked entertainer on Forbes World's Most Powerful Women in the eleventh position.[98][99] In March 2012, Gaga was ranked fourth on Billboard's list of top moneymakers of 2011 with earnings of $25 million, which included sales from Born This Way and her Monster Ball Tour.[100]","During this period, Gaga recorded a jazz version of ""The Lady Is a Tramp"" with Tony Bennett[101] and lent her vocals to a song with Elton John for the animated feature film, Gnomeo & Juliet.[102][103] She held a concert at the Sydney Town Hall, Australia, to promote Born This Way, and at the celebration of former US president Bill Clinton's 65th birthday.[104][105] Later that year, Gaga directed the critically acclaimed Thanksgiving Day television special, A Very Gaga Thanksgiving, which attained 5.749 million American viewers, and spawned the release of her fourth EP, A Very Gaga Holiday.[106][107][108] In May 2012, Gaga guest-starred as an animated version of herself on the 23rd-season finale of The Simpsons, titled ""Lisa Goes Gaga"".[109][110] She also appeared in Tony Bennett's documentary film, The Zen of Bennett (2012).[111] The following month, she announced her first fragrance in association with Coty, Inc., Lady Gaga Fame, which was released worldwide in September 2012.[112]","New songs for Gaga's third studio album, Artpop, were beginning to take definite form as she worked with producer Fernando Garibay in early 2012.[113][114] Work on the album continued well into the Born This Way Ball tour.[115] She yearned to make audiences have ""a really good time"" with Artpop, crafting the album to mirror ""a night at the club"".[116] Artpop was released in November 2013. Despite mixed reviews,[117] it debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, and has sold 2.5 million copies as of July 2014.[118][119] The album spawned successful singles in ""Applause"" and ""Do What U Want"", featuring R&B singer R. Kelly.[120][121][122] A third release, ""G.U.Y."", became Gaga's weakest performing single to date.[123][124] Gaga embarked on the accompanying ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour several months later, building upon concepts from her ArtRave promotional event. Scooping up $83 million, the itinerary saw her visit new cities and several locations initially included in the Born This Way Ball tour.[125][126] Meanwhile, Gaga split from longtime manager Troy Carter over ""creative differences"",[127] and by June 2014, she and new manager Bobby Campbell joined Artist Nation, the artist management division of Live Nation Entertainment.[128] She topped Forbes' List of Top-Earning Celebs Under 30, and ranked second on the Celebrity 100 List and Time's anniversary poll of the most influential people of the past ten years.[129][130]","Gaga starred in Robert Rodriguez's Machete Kills (2013), a critical and commercial failure that earned her a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress nomination.[131][132] The singer also hosted the November 16, 2013 episode of Saturday Night Live, where she performed ""Do What U Want"" (with Kelly) and an album cut, ""Gypsy"".[133][134] Later that month, she held her second Thanksgiving Day television special on ABC, Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular.[135] Gaga had a cameo in another Robert Rodriguez film, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, released on August 22, 2014.[136] She was confirmed as the Versace's spring-summer 2014 face with a campaign called ""Lady Gaga For Versace"".[137][138]","In 2014, Gaga collaborated with American jazz singer Tony Bennett on the jazz album Cheek to Cheek. She explained her inspiration behind the album: ""Cheek to Cheek came out of a very organic friendship and relationship that Tony and I have built over the years and it truly was a collaborative effort... I've been singing jazz since I was a child and really wanted to show the authentic side of the genre.""[139] The album received generally favorable reviews,[140] with Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian praising Gaga's vocals in it, and Chicago Tribune critic Howard Reich wrote that ""Cheek to Cheek serves up the real thing, start to finish"".[141][142] The album debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Gaga's third consecutive number-one record in the United States,[143] and went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.[144] The duo recorded a concert special, called Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live!,[145] and embarked on the Cheek to Cheek Tour, which began in December 2014 and concluded in August 2015.[146] The same year, Gaga also had a seven-day residency show commemorating the final performance at New York's Roseland Ballroom before its closure.[147] She also released her second fragrance in association with Coty Inc., named Eau de Gaga.[148]","Gaga began 2015 with her engagement to Taylor Kinney in February.[149] Later that month, she performed at the 87th Academy Awards, where she sang a medley of songs from The Sound of Music in a cut-glass English accent. The performance triggered over 214,000 interactions per minute globally on Facebook.[150] Gaga then performed a piano version of John Lennon's ""Imagine"" at the opening ceremony of the 2015 European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan.[151] She and Diane Warren co-wrote the song ""Til It Happens to You"" for the documentary The Hunting Ground, which earned them the Satellite Award for Best Original Song and an Academy Award nomination in the same category.[152][153] A few months later, Gaga and Tony Bennett featured in a commercial for Barnes & Noble's 2015 holiday campaign, for which they recorded a rendition of ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"".[154] Outside of music, Gaga appeared in Nick Knight's 2015 fashion film for Tom Ford's 2016 spring campaign.[155] From October 2015 to January 2016, she starred as a hotel owner named Elizabeth in the fifth season of the horror show American Horror Story, entitled Hotel.[156][157] Gaga's performance received mixed reviews,[158] though she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for her role.[159] She followed with signing with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) having previously been signed with William Morris Endeavor (WME).[160]","For Gaga, 2015 ended with the Woman of the Year award from Billboard.[161] Among other accolades, she received Contemporary Icon Award at the 2015 Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Awards,[162] and the Young Artist Award at the 2015 National Arts Awards,[163] and ranked number 25 as the third female singer on the 2015 Forbes Celebrity 100 list, with earnings of $59 million.[164] In January 2016, Gaga was invited to be the guest editor for the V magazine for its 99th issue, which features sixteen different covers.[165] She subsequently received the award for Editor of the Year for her work on the magazine in March during the Fashion Los Angeles Awards.[166]","Gaga performed live at several events in 2016. These included singing the US national anthem in February, at Super Bowl 50,[167][168] partnering with Intel and Nile Rodgers for a tribute performance to the late David Bowie at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards,[169] and singing ""Til It Happens to You"" at the 88th Academy Awards, where she was introduced by Joe Biden and accompanied on-stage by 50 sexual assault survivors.[170] Gaga, in April 2016, was honored at the Jane Ortner Education Award by The Grammy Museum, with the Jane Ortner Artist Award, which recognizes artists who has demonstrated passion and dedication to education through the arts.[171] To support their charities, Gaga and Elton John released a clothing and accessories line at Macy's in May 2016.[172] Gaga called off her engagement to Taylor Kinney in July 2016.[173][174]","Gaga played a witch named Scathach in American Horror Story: Roanoke, the series' sixth iteration,[175] which ran from September to November 2016.[176][177] Her role in the fifth season of the show ultimately influenced the creative process of her fifth studio album Joanne. She told Entertainment Weekly, ""[I] returned to something I've believed in so much, which is the art of darkness"".[178] Gaga released the album's lead single ""Perfect Illusion"" in September 2016,[179] which debuted at number one in France and Spain.[180] Joanne was released the following month, and sold 170,000 copies in the US during its first week, becoming Gaga's fourth album to reach number one in the nation. As a result, Gaga became the first woman to have four US number one albums in the 2010s.[181] To promote Joanne, Gaga embarked on a three-date tour, sponsored by Bud Light, called Dive Bar Tour.[182] The album's second single ""Million Reasons"" was released later, which she performed at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 in Paris.[183] It has reached number four in the United States.[184]","Gaga performed as the headlining act at the Super Bowl LI halftime show on February 5, 2017.[185][186] The performance featured a coordinated swarm of hundreds of lighted drones that formed various shapes in the sky above Houston's NRG Stadium. It was the first time robotic aircraft appeared in a Super Bowl program.[187] The performance garnered 117.5 million viewers based on American television ratings, exceeding the game's total of 113.3 million viewers.[188] It became the most viewed music performance in history, generating over 150 million viewers among all platforms.[189] As a result of her popular halftime performance, she sold an additional 150,000 digital albums.[190] She also announced that night that she would embark on the Joanne World Tour in support of Joanne, which will take place from April to December 2017. The first two dates took place during the 2017 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[191][192] During her set at Coachella, Gaga debuted and concurrently released her new single, ""The Cure"".[193]","Gaga will star in Bradley Cooper's remake of the 1937 musical drama film, A Star Is Born, being distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, and create new music for the project. Filming commenced in 2017,[194][195] and the film is expected to be released on September 28, 2018.[196]","Continually experimenting with new musical ideas and images, Gaga's musical and performance style is the subject of much analysis and scrutiny from critics. She professes that she is ""liberating"" herself by constantly reinventing her sound and image, insisting that she has been drawn to such a practice since her childhood.[197] Refusing to lip sync, Gaga – whose range is frequently compared to those of Madonna and Gwen Stefani – has manipulated her vocal style over the course of her career yet considers Born This Way (2011) ""much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of.""[198][199] In summation of her voice, Entertainment Weekly wrote: ""There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power.""[200] Gaga possesses a contralto vocal range.[201]","Although her early songs have been called ""depthless,""[202] ""[Gaga] does manage to get you moving and grooving at an almost effortless pace,"" according to Evan Sawdey of PopMatters.[203] Gaga believes that ""all good music can be played on a piano and still sound like a hit.""[204] She has covered a wide variety of topics in her songs: while The Fame (2008) meditates on the lust for stardom, The Fame Monster (2009) expresses fame's dark side through monster metaphors. Born This Way (2011) is sung in English, French, German, and Spanish and includes common themes in Gaga's controversial songwriting such as: sex, love, religion, money, drugs, identity, liberation, sexuality, freedom, and individualism.[205][206]","Her music style has been described as electropop[207] and as dance-pop[208] and the structure of her music is said to be influenced by classic 1980s pop and 1990s Europop.[209] Her debut album The Fame (2008) provoked The Sunday Times to assert ""in combining music, fashion, art and technology, [Gaga] evokes Madonna, Gwen Stefani circa 'Hollaback Girl', Kylie Minogue 2001 or Grace Jones right now"", and a critic from The Boston Globe to comment that she draws: ""obvious inspirations from Madonna to Gwen Stefani... in [her] girlish but sturdy pipes and bubbly beats.""[210][211] Music critic Simon Reynolds wrote that: ""Everything about Gaga came from electroclash, except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s, just ruthlessly catchy naughties pop glazed with Auto-Tune and undergirded with R&B-ish beats.""[212] The follow-up The Fame Monster (2009), saw Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on ""Seventies arena glam, perky ABBA disco, and sugary throwbacks like Stacey Q"" while Born This Way (2011) also draws on the records of her childhood and still has the ""electro-sleaze beats and Eurodisco chorus chants"" of its predecessor but includes genres as diverse as opera, heavy metal, disco, and rock and roll.[205] ""There isn't a subtle moment on the album, but even at its nuttiest, the music is full of wide-awake emotional details,"" wrote Rolling Stone, which concluded: ""The more excessive Gaga gets, the more honest she sounds.""[206] With 2014's Cheek to Cheek, Gaga dabbled in the jazz genre. Although critically appreciated for her love of the music, and the songs she recorded on the album, it was noted that Gaga's attempt to switch genres, with ""her rhythmically square, shouty delivery"", left her vocals sounding more like a Broadway singer than a real jazz musician.[213]","Gaga grew up listening to artists such as: The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Blondie, and Garbage,[214] who all influenced her.[215][216] She has cited heavy metal bands as an influence, stating that Iron Maiden ""changed my life"" and describing herself as ""the biggest Black Sabbath fan on Earth"".[217] Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers like Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists like David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater.[37][218][219][220] Gaga has often been compared to Madonna who admits that she sees herself reflected in Gaga.[221] In response to the comparisons, Gaga stated in February 2011: ""I don't want to sound presumptuous, but I've made it my goal to revolutionize pop music. The last revolution was launched by Madonna 25 years ago"" in addition to commenting that: ""there is really no one that is a more adoring and loving Madonna fan than me.""[222] Like Madonna, Gaga has continued to reinvent herself and has drawn inspiration from the music and performances of a diverse mix of artists including: Cyndi Lauper,[223] Depeche Mode,[224] Prince,[225][226] Lily Allen,[227] Marilyn Manson,[228] Yoko Ono,[229] Ace of Base, Amber,[230] Grace Jones,[231] Beyoncé,[232] Britney Spears,[233] and Christina Aguilera.[234]","Another spiritual influence on Gaga has been the Indian physician, public speaker, and writer Deepak Chopra. Labeling him a ""true inspiration"", she stated that ""he's always reminded me to work in a life of service to my fans and to fulfill my vision and my destiny"" in addition to thinking about Chopra when it comes to her work as a musician: ""I want so much for it to go beyond the music for my fans.""[235] Gaga also lifted a quote from Osho's book Creativity on Twitter.[236][237] When asked about her connection to him, Gaga said she was influenced by his work and that, for her, ""the creativity is the greatest way of rebellion"": ""Equality"", she concluded, ""is one of the most important things in my life.""[238]","Gaga has identified fashion as a major influence and claimed that her interest in fashion came from her mother who was ""always very well kept and beautiful.""[239] Her musical endeavors are directly linked with fashion with the singer explaining: ""When I'm writing music, I'm thinking about the clothes I want to wear on stage. It's all about everything altogether—performance art, pop performance art, fashion.""[30] Gaga has been stylistically compared to Leigh Bowery, Isabella Blow, and Cher.[17][30][240][241] She commented that as a child, she somehow absorbed Cher's out-there fashion sense and made it her own.[241] Gaga considers Donatella Versace her muse, and the late English fashion designer and close friend Alexander McQueen as an inspiration, admitting that ""I miss Lee every time I get dressed"" while channeling him in some of her work.[17][83] In turn, Versace calls Lady Gaga ""the fresh Donatella"".[242] Modeled on Andy Warhol's Factory, Gaga has her own creative production team, which she handles personally, called the Haus of Gaga, who create many of her clothes, stage props, and hairdos.[243] Other fashion influences came from Princess Diana: ""I love Princess Diana so much. She was an enormous influence on me when I was younger because my mother worshiped her so much. When she died, I'll never forget, my mother was crying. It was this very powerful moment in my childhood watching my mother so connected to someone"".[244]","With constant costume changes and provocative visuals, Gaga's music videos are often described as short films.[245] ""Being provocative is not just about getting people's attention. It's about saying something that really affects people in a real way, in a positive way,"" she professes.[245] According to author Curtis Fogel, exploring bondage and sadomasochism in addition to highlighting prevalent feminist themes, ""the three central themes that shape Gaga's music videos are sex, violence, and power.""[246] While she labels herself ""a little bit of a feminist"" and asserts that she is ""sexually empowering women"",[247] Gaga strives to empower young women to stand up for what they believe in.[246] ""She not only reiterates her assertion of total originality,"" professed pop critic Ann Powers, ""but also finesses it until it's both a philosophical stance about how constructing a persona from pop-cultural sources can be an expression of a person's truth—a la those drag queens Gaga sincerely admires—and a bit of a feminist act.""[248] In summation of her videos, Rolling Stone used the rhetoric: ""does anyone look to a Lady Gaga video for restraint?""[91]","Her performances are described as ""highly entertaining and innovative""; the blood-spurting performance of ""Paparazzi"" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was described as ""eye-popping"" by MTV News.[249] She continued the ""blood soaked"" theme during The Monster Ball Tour, and triggered protests in England from family groups and fans in the aftermath of a local tragedy, in which a taxi driver had murdered 12 people.[250] Her unconventionality continued at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards: appearing in drag as her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, and delivering a lovesick monologue before a performance of her song ""You and I"".[251] As Gaga's choreographer and creative director, Laurieann Gibson provided material for her shows and videos for four years only to be replaced by Gibson's assistant Richard Jackson.[252] Gaga admits to being a perfectionist when it comes to her elaborate shows. ""I'm very bossy. I can scream my head off if I see one light fixture out. I'm very detailed – every minute of the show has got to be perfect.""[245]","Public reception of Gaga's music, fashion sense and persona is polarized.[253] Critics have pointed out her unique place in pop music, the need for new movements in popular culture, the attention Gaga brings to modern social issues, and the inherently subjective nature of her art.[254][255] In view of her influence on modern culture and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the University of South Carolina has offered a course titled ""Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame"" since spring 2011 with the objective of unravelling: ""some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga.""[256][257] When Gaga briefly met with US president Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he described the interaction as ""intimidating"" as she was dressed in 16-inch heels making her undoubtedly the tallest woman in the room.[258]","Towards the end of 2008, comparisons were made between the fashions of Gaga and Aguilera, that noted similarities in their styling, hair, and make-up.[17] Aguilera stated that she was ""completely unaware of [Gaga]"".[17] Comparisons continued into 2010, when Aguilera released the music video of her single ""Not Myself Tonight"". Critics noted similarities between the song and its accompanying music video and Gaga's video for ""Bad Romance"".[259] When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend. Responding to a question on this issue, she stated, ""At first it was very strange and everyone sorta said, 'That's really quite a story!' But in a sense, I portray myself in a very androgynous way, and I love androgyny.""[260]","Gaga's outlandish fashion sense has also been one of her characteristic aspects.[261] The Global Language Monitor named ""Lady Gaga"" as the Top Fashion Buzzword with her trademark ""no pants"" a close third.[262] Entertainment Weekly put her outfits on its end of the decade ""best-of"" list, saying: ""Whether it's a dress made of Muppets or strategically placed bubbles, Gaga's outré ensembles brought performance art into the mainstream.""[263] Time placed Gaga on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons List amongst some of Gaga's inspirations such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, and The Beatles, stating: ""Lady Gaga is just as notorious for her outrageous style as she is for her pop hits. After all, Gaga, born Stefani Germanotta, has sported outfits made from plastic bubbles, Kermit the Frog dolls, and raw meat.""[264]","Gaga wore a dress made of raw beef to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards which was supplemented by boots, a purse, and a hat also made out of raw beef.[265] Partly awarded in recognition of the dress, Vogue named her one of the Best Dressed people of 2010 while Time named the dress the Fashion Statement of 2010. However, it prompted divided opinions, attracting the attention of worldwide media but also invoking the fury of animal rights organization PETA.[266][267][268] In 2012, Gaga became a feature of a temporary exhibition The Elevated: From the Pharaoh to Lady Gaga marking the 150th anniversary of the National Museum in Warsaw.[269] Gaga was presented in a dress of raw meat, described by Polish weekly Wprost as: ""an icon of modernity elevated by the power which she exercises over mass media"".[270] The meat dress was later displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts,[271] and entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 2015.[272] As Gaga appeared at the 87th Academy Awards and subsequent events, she changed her style and fashion, transforming into a more glamorous person; Vogue compared her to that of Marilyn Monroe and MTV News described the change as ""more acceptably 'natural' or 'classic'"".[273][274][275]","Devout fans of Gaga call her ""Mother Monster"", while Gaga often refers to her fans as ""Little Monsters,"" a phrase which she had tattooed on herself in dedication.[276] To some, this dichotomy contravenes the concept of outsider culture. Camille Paglia, in her 2010 cover story ""Lady Gaga and the death of sex"" in The Sunday Times, asserts that Gaga: ""is more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those.""[202][277] Writing for The Guardian, Kitty Empire opined that the dichotomy: ""...allows the viewer to have a 'transgressive' experience without being required to think. At [her performance's] core, though, is the idea that Gaga is at one with the freaks and outcasts.""[278] In July 2012, Gaga also co-founded the website LittleMonsters.com, which became the first official social network devoted to fans of an artist.[279]","Alongside her music career, Gaga has contributed to various charities. For natural disasters, Gaga has helped various relief efforts. Although declining an invitation to appear on the single ""We Are the World 25"" to benefit victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, she donated the proceeds of her concert of January 24, 2010, at New York's Radio City Music Hall to the country's reconstruction relief fund.[280] All profits from her official online store on that day were also donated. Gaga announced that an estimated total of $500,000 was collected for the fund.[281] Hours after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami hit Japan on March 11, 2011, Gaga tweeted a message and a link to Japan Prayer Bracelets. All revenue from a bracelet she designed in conjunction with the company was donated to relief efforts.[282] As of March 29, 2011, the bracelets raised $1.5 million.[283] However, attorney Alyson Oliver filed a lawsuit against Gaga in Detroit in June 2011, noting that the bracelet was subject to a sales tax and an extra $3.99 shipping charge was added to the price. She also believed that not all proceeds from the bracelets would go to the relief efforts, demanding a public accounting of the campaign and refunds for people who had bought the bracelet. Gaga's spokesperson called the lawsuit ""meritless"" and ""misleading"".[284] On June 25, 2011, Gaga performed at MTV Japan's charity show in Makuhari Messe, which benefited the Japanese Red Cross.[285]","In 2012, Gaga joined the anti-fracking campaign Artists Against Fracking.[286] In October 2012, Gaga was reported to have met the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.[287] On October 9, 2012, Yoko Ono gave Gaga and four other activists the LennonOno Grant for Peace in Reykjavík, Iceland.[288] On November 6, 2012, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Gaga also contributes in the fight against HIV and AIDS, focusing on educating young women about the risks of the disease. In collaboration with Cyndi Lauper, Gaga joined forces with MAC Cosmetics to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam. In a press release, Gaga declared, ""I don't want Viva Glam to be just a lipstick you buy to help a cause. I want it to be a reminder when you go out at night to put a condom in your purse right next to your lipstick.""[289] The sales of Gaga-endorsed Viva Glam lipstick and lip gloss have raised more than $202 million to fight HIV and AIDS.[290]","On April 7, 2016, Gaga joined Vice President Joe Biden at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to support Biden's It's On Us campaign as he travels to colleges on behalf of the organization, which has seen 250,000 students from more than 530 colleges sign a pledge of solidarity and activation.[291] On June 26, 2016, Gaga attended the 84th Annual US Conference of Mayors in Indianapolis where she joined with Dalai Lama to talk about the power of kindness and how to make the world a more compassionate place.[292] The Chinese government added Gaga to a list of hostile foreign forces, and Chinese websites and media organizations were ordered to stop uploading or distributing her songs. The Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CCPPD) also issued order for State-controlled media to condemn this meeting.[293] On July 28, 2016, Gaga headlined a private concert in Camden, New Jersey, called Camden Rising, as part of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of Hillary Clinton.[294]","In 2012, she launched the Born This Way Foundation (BTWF), a non-profit organization that focuses on youth empowerment and issues like self-confidence, well-being, anti-bullying, mentoring, and career development. It takes its name from the 2011 single and album. The foundation plans to work with a number of partners, including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, The California Endowment, and the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University.[295] Media proprietor Oprah Winfrey, writer Deepak Chopra, and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the inauguration at Harvard University.[296][297] The foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from Barneys New York.[298] The foundation works in partnership with the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, the MacArthur Foundation, the California Endowment,[299] and, as lead media partner, Viacom.[300] In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with Office Depot, which will donate 25% of the sales-a minimum of $1million-of a series of limited edition back-to-school products that promote the foundation's message[301] The foundation's initiatives have included, in March–April 2012, a poster competition that asked participants to submit images that answer the question ""What does bravery mean to you?"";[302] the ""Born Brave Bus"" that would follow her on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying,[303][304] and the ""Born Brave"" community and school groups.[305]","On October 24, 2015, at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Gaga joined 200 high school students, top policy makers, and academic officials, including Yale President Peter Salovey, a pioneer in the study of emotional intelligence, to discuss ways to recognize and channel emotions for positive outcomes.[306] In 2016, the foundation partnered with Intel, Vox Media and Re/code to fight online harassment.[307] It was also announced that the sale of the cover of the 99th issue of the V magazine, which featured Gaga and Kinney, was donated to the foundation to bring cutting-edge, social-emotional intelligence research.[165] Gaga and Elton John released a clothing and accessories line on Macy's on May 9, 2016, entitled Love Bravery, in which twenty-five percent of each purchase will support the Born This Way Foundation and the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[172]","Gaga is an outspoken activist for LGBT rights worldwide.[308] She attributes much of her early success as a mainstream artist to her gay fans and is considered a gay icon.[309] Early in her career she had difficulty getting radio airplay, and stated, ""The turning point for me was the gay community.""[310] She thanked FlyLife, a Manhattan-based LGBT marketing company with whom her label Interscope works, in the liner notes of The Fame.[311] One of her first televised performances was in May 2008 at the NewNowNext Awards, an awards show aired by the LGBT television network Logo.[312] In June of the same year, she performed at the San Francisco Pride event.[313] After The Fame was released, she revealed that the song ""Poker Face"" was about her bisexuality. In an interview with Rolling Stone, she spoke about how her boyfriends tended to react to her bisexuality, saying: ""The fact that I'm into women, they're all intimidated by it. It makes them uncomfortable. They're like, 'I don't need to have a threesome. I'm happy with just you'.""[39] When she appeared as a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in May 2009, she praised DeGeneres for being: ""an inspiration for women and for the gay community"".[314]","Gaga spoke at the 2009 National Equality March in Washington, D.C. in support of LGBT movement, and described the appearance as ""the single most important moment"" of her career.[315] She attended the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards accompanied by four gay and lesbian former members of the United States Armed Forces who had been unable to serve openly under the U.S. military's ""Don't ask, don't tell"" (DADT) policy.[316] Gaga released three videos on YouTube urging her fans to contact their Senators in an effort to overturn DADT. In September 2010 she spoke at a Servicemembers Legal Defense Network's rally in Portland, Maine. Following this event, editors of The Advocate commented that she had become a ""fierce advocate"" for gays and lesbians.[317] Gaga appeared at Europride, a pan-European international event dedicated to LGBT pride, held in Rome in June 2011. She criticized the intolerant state of gay rights in many European countries and described gay people as ""revolutionaries of love"".[318] Gaga was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church Monastery so that she could officiate the wedding of long-time friends, both of whom were women.[319] In June 2016, during a vigil held in Los Angeles for victims of the attack at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Gaga read aloud the names of the 49 people killed in the attack, and also gave a supporting speech.[320] Also in June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of that attack; in the video, Gaga and others told the stories of the people killed there.[321][322]","As of January 2016, Gaga had sold an estimated 27 million albums and 146 million singles worldwide; her singles are some of the best-selling worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists.[323] She has also been noted, as of 2014, as a touring force, having grossed more than $300 million in revenue from 3.2 million tickets for her first three worldwide concert tours.[128]","Moreover, Gaga was named the ""Queen of Pop"" in a 2011 ranking by Rolling Stone (based on record sales and social media metrics),[253] and has been regarded as a trailblazer throughout several points in her career, sometimes utilizing controversy to bring attention to various issues.[324] With the meteoric success of The Fame, Gaga is credited as being one of the front-runners of the rise in the popularity of synthpop in the late 2000s and early 2010s.[325][326][327] ""It's all about how you cultivate your community,"" writer Brian Solis said. ""Celebs have never shied away from causes and in many ways it's expected that they will use their celebrity to gain attention for those causes. But it's what (Gaga) does over time and how her community responds that starts the lean-over into the influence factor."" Polaroid CEO, after working with Gaga, said: ""she's a true artist who inspires her fans and the creative community. The relationship she has with her fans is exceptionally close and she is consistently in contact with them via social networks, making her messages accessible, authentic and far reaching.""[328] According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker, ""Lady Gaga blazed a trail for truculent pop stars by treating her own celebrity as an evolving art project.""[329] In 2015, Time also noted that Gaga had ""practically invented the current era of pop music as spectacle.""[330] Her work has influenced Miley Cyrus,[331] Nicki Minaj,[332] Ellie Goulding,[333] Halsey,[334][335] Nick Jonas,[336] Lorde,[337] Sam Smith,[338] Greyson Chance,[339] Debbie Harry of Blondie,[340] Noah Cyrus,[341] Ashley Tisdale,[342] Zara Larsson,[343] Katherine Langford,[344] and MGMT.[345]","Gaga has been commemorated in the scientific names of several organisms. A new genus of ferns, Gaga, and two species, G. germanotta and G. monstraparva have been named in her honor. The name monstraparva alluded to Gaga's fans known as ""little monsters"" since their symbol is the outstretched ""monster claw"" hand, which resembles a tightly in-rolled young fern leaf prior to unfurling.[346] Gaga also has an extinct mammal, Gagadon minimonstrum, and a parasitic wasp, Aleiodes gaga, named for her.[347][348][349]","Lady Gaga's recognition for her work includes six Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards,[350] a Golden Globe Award, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, twelve Guinness World Records,[171][verification needed] and a Songwriters Hall of Fame's Contemporary Icon Award, which she was the first artist ever to win.[162] In addition she was a recipient of a National Arts Awards' Young Artist Award, which honors individuals who have achieved incredible accomplishments and exemplary leadership while still early in their career,[163] and honored at the Jane Ortner Education Award by The Grammy Museum, with the Jane Ortner Artist Award, which recognizes artists who has demonstrated passion and dedication to education through the arts.[171] Gaga has also been recognized by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) with the Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award, a special prize reserved for: ""an individual whose style has made a significant impact on popular culture on an international stage"".[351]","Gaga has consecutively appeared on Billboard magazine's Artists of the Year (scoring the definitive title in 2010),[352] and named as Woman of the Year in 2015,[161] is the fifth best selling digital singles artist in the United States according to RIAA with a total of 59 million certified.[353] She also became the first woman to receive the Digital Diamond Award from RIAA,[354] and is the first and only artist to have two songs pass 7 million downloads (""Poker Face"" and ""Just Dance"").[355] She is regularly placed on lists composed by Forbes magazine,[290] including their list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women from 2010 to 2014,[356] named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2010,[357] and the ""second most influential people of the past ten years"" through a readers' poll in 2013.[130] In 2016, she was a finalist for The Advocate's Person of the Year.[358]"
Twitter,"Twitter (/ˈtwɪtər/) is an online news and social networking service where users post and interact with messages, ""tweets,"" restricted to 140 characters. Registered users can post tweets, but those who are unregistered can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface, SMS or a mobile device app.[10] Twitter Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, United States, and has more than 25 offices around the world.[11]","Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams and launched in July. The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity. In 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day,[12] and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[13][14][15] In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as ""the SMS of the Internet"".[16][17] As of 2016, Twitter had more than 319 million monthly active users.[6] On the day of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter proved to be the largest source of breaking news, with 40 million election-related tweets sent by 10 p.m. (Eastern Time) that day.[18]",,,"Twitter's origins lie in a ""daylong brainstorming session"" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.[19][20] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[21] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter.[22] The developers initially considered ""10958"" as a short code, but later changed it to ""40404"" for ""ease of use and memorability"".[23] Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST): ""just setting up my twttr"".[1] Dorsey has explained the origin of the ""Twitter"" title:","...we came across the word 'twitter', and it was just perfect. The definition was 'a short burst of inconsequential information,' and 'chirps from birds'. And that's exactly what the product was.[24]","The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees[25] and the full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006.[7] In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders.[26] Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011.[27] Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.[28] Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview:","With Twitter, it wasn't clear what it was. They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.[29]","The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.[30] ""The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,"" remarked Newsweek's Steven Levy. ""Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.""[31]","Reaction at the conference was highly positive. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter was ""absolutely ruling"" SXSWi. Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter was ""owning"" the conference.[32] Twitter staff received the festival's Web Award prize with the remark ""we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less.

The original logo was in use from its launch in March 2006 until September 2010. A slightly modified version succeeded the first style when the website underwent its first redesign.,"On February 27, 2012, a tweet from an employee that works on the company's platform and API discussed the evolution of the ""Larry the Bird"" logo with Twitter's creative director and it was revealed that it was named after Larry Bird of the NBA's Boston Celtics fame. This detail had been confirmed when the Boston Celtics' director of interactive media asked Twitter co-founder Biz Stone about it in August 2011.[129]","On June 5, 2012, Twitter unveiled its third logo redesign, replacing Larry the Bird with an updated icon simply named as the ""Twitter Bird"". As of this logo revision, the word ""Twitter"" and the lowercase letter ""t"" are no longer used, with the bird becoming the sole symbol for the company's branding.[130] According to Douglas Bowman, designer of Twitter, the new logo resembles a mountain bluebird.[131] Twitter explains on their website not to modify the logo (e.g. rotate the bird, change the logo's color, etc.).[132]","Tweets are publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers. Users can tweet via the Twitter website, compatible external applications (such as for smartphones), or by Short Message Service (SMS) available in certain countries.[133] Users may subscribe to other users' tweets—this is known as ""following"" and subscribers are known as ""followers""[134] or ""tweeps"", a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps.[135] Individual tweets can be forwarded by other users to their own feed, a process known as a ""retweet"". Users can also ""like"" (formerly ""favorite"") individual tweets.[136] Twitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phone either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets.[137] Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client.[138] In a 2009 Time essay, technology author Steven Johnson described the basic mechanics of Twitter as ""remarkably simple"":[139]","As a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers. When you choose to follow another Twitter user, that user's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page. If you follow 20 people, you'll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page: breakfast-cereal updates, interesting new links, music recommendations, even musings on the future of education.","According to research published in April 2014, around 44 percent of user accounts have never tweeted.[140]","The first tweet was posted by Jack Dorsey (creator) at 12:50 PM PST on March 21, 2006 and read ""just setting up my twittr"".[141]","On October 21, 2009, the first tweet was sent from space.

Similarly, the ""@"" sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users.[146] To repost a message from another Twitter user and share it with one's own followers, a user can click the retweet button within the Tweet.","In late 2009, the ""Twitter Lists"" feature was added, making it possible for users to follow ad hoc lists of authors instead of individual authors.[134][147]","Through SMS, users can communicate with Twitter through five gateway numbers: short codes for the United States, Canada, India, New Zealand, and an Isle of Man-based number for international use. There is also a short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone, O2[148] and Orange[149] networks. In India, since Twitter only supports tweets from Bharti Airtel,[150] an alternative platform called smsTweet[151] was set up by a user to work on all networks.[152] A similar platform called GladlyCast exists for mobile phone users in Singapore and Malaysia.[153]","The tweets were set to a largely constrictive 140-character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging, introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages. The 140-character limit also increased the usage of URL shortening services such as bit.ly, goo.gl, and tr.im, and content-hosting services, such as Twitpic, memozu.com and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters. Since June 2011, Twitter has used its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its website, making other link shorteners superfluous for staying within the 140 character limit.[154][155]","On May 24, 2016, Twitter announced that media such as photos and videos, and the person's handle, would not count against the 140 character limit. A user photo post used to count for about 24 characters.[156] Attachments and links will also no longer be part of the character limit.[157]","On July 17, 2016, Twitter launched a new way for advertisers to target users that have tweeted with a certain emoji or engaged with tweets with a certain emoji.[158]","A word, phrase or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a ""trending topic"". Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users, or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic.[159] These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what people's opinions are about it.[160]","Trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly musicians like Lady Gaga (known as Little Monsters), Justin Bieber (Beliebers), Rihanna (Rih Navy) and One Direction (Directioners), and novel series Twilight (Twihards) and Harry Potter (Potterheads). Twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type, with limited success.[161]","The Twitter web interface displays a list of trending topics on a sidebar on the home page, along with sponsored content (see image).",Twitter often censors trending hashtags that are claimed to be abusive or offensive. Twitter censored the #Thatsafrican[162] and #thingsdarkiessay hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive.[163] There are allegations that Twitter removed #NaMOinHyd from the trending list and added an Indian National Congress-sponsored hashtag.[164],"There are numerous tools for adding content, monitoring content and conversations including Telly (video sharing, old name is Twitvid),[165] TweetDeck, Salesforce.com, HootSuite, and Twitterfeed. As of 2009[update], fewer than half of tweets posted were posted using the web user interface with most users using third-party applications (based on an analysis of 500 million tweets by Sysomos).[166]","A verified Twitter account formally validates the identity of the person or company that owns the account—the aim of the ""verified"" status is to prove that a real-world person or company is not being impersonated, through the placement of a small blue checkmark by the top-right corner of a user's page, or next to the username in the platform's Search function.[167] Twitter is responsible for assigning the blue checkmark, and it is frequently applied to the accounts of notable people in politics, music, movies, business, fashion, government, sports, media, and journalism.[168]",The owners of verified accounts can also access additional features that are not available to standard Twitter-account holders.[169] These features include:,"Verified status does not imply that Twitter continuously checks whether such accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015.[171] Some users have tried to impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images. Twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult.[172] In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone to apply for a verified account.[173]","Twitter has mobile apps for iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows 10, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, and Nokia S40.[174] Users can also tweet by sending SMS.[175] In April 2017, Twitter introduced ""Twitter Lite"", a progressive web app designed for regions with unreliable and slow Internet connections, with a size of less than one megabyte, designed for devices with limited storage capacity.[176][177]","For many years, Twitter has limited the use of third party applications accessing the service by implementing a 100,000 user limit per application.[178]","Since August 31, 2010, third-party Twitter applications have been required to use OAuth, an authentication method that does not require users to enter their password into the authenticating application. This was done to increase security and improve the user experience.[179]","This feature adds websites to the bottom of a tweet's permalink page. If a website embedded a tweet onto one of their stories, the tweet will show the websites that mentioned the tweet. This feature was added onto Twitter so if the viewer doesn't understand what the tweet means, they can click on the sites to read more about what the person is talking about.[180]","On October 21, 2015, Twitter began to roll out the ability to attach poll questions to tweets. Polls are open for up to 7 days, and voters are not personally identified.[181]","Twitter is ranked as one of the ten-most-visited websites worldwide by Alexa's web traffic analysis.[182] Daily user estimates vary as the company does not publish statistics on active accounts. A February 2009 Compete.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits.[40] In March 2009, a Nielsen.com blog ranked Twitter as the fastest-growing website in the Member Communities category for February 2009. Twitter had annual growth of 1,382 percent, increasing from 475,000 unique visitors in February 2008 to 7 million in February 2009.[183] In 2009, Twitter had a monthly user retention rate of forty percent.[184]","In 2009, Twitter was mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter, said Jeremiah Owyang, an industry analyst studying social media. ""Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years,"" he said.[187] According to comScore only eleven percent of Twitter's users are aged twelve to seventeen.[187] comScore attributed this to Twitter's ""early adopter period"" when the social network first gained popularity in business settings and news outlets attracting primarily older users. However, comScore also stated in 2009 that Twitter had begun to ""filter more into the mainstream"", and ""along with it came a culture of celebrity as Shaq, Britney Spears and Ashton Kutcher joined the ranks of the Twitterati"".[188]","According to a study by Sysomos in June 2009, women make up a slightly larger Twitter demographic than men—fifty-three percent over forty-seven percent.

Later, when he found it was exploitable again, he created the account 'RainbowTwtr' and used it to post coloured messages.[263] Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for ""onMouseOver"",[263] and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself.[262] Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for ""fun and games"", but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals.[262] Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13:50 UTC that ""The exploit is fully patched.""[262][264] Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed.[265]","In May 2011, a claimant known as ""CTB"" (subsequently identified as Ryan Giggs) in the case of CTB v Twitter Inc., Persons Unknown took legal action at the High Court of Justice in London against Twitter,[266] requesting that Twitter release details of account holders. This followed gossip posted on Twitter about Giggs' private life, causing conflict relating to privacy injunctions.[267][268] Tony Wang, the head of Twitter in Europe, said that people who do ""bad things"" on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy, and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so.[269] He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for ""illegal activity"" on the site.[270]","On May 29, 2011, it was reported that South Tyneside council in England had successfully taken legal action against Twitter in a court in California, forcing Twitter to reveal the details of five user accounts. The council was trying to discover the identity of a blogger called ""Mr Monkey""[271] who allegedly posted libellous statements about three local councillors.[272]","On January 23, 2012, it was reported that Twitter would be acquiring Dasient, a startup that offers malware protection for businesses. Twitter announced plans to use Dasient to help remove hateful advertisers on the website.[273]","On January 26, 2012, Twitter began offering a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country. Twitter cited France and Germany as examples, where pro-Nazi content is illegal. Deleted tweets used to be removed in all countries.[274][275] The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo-Nazi group Besseres Hannover (de) on October 18, 2012.[276] The policy was used again the following day to remove anti-Semitic French tweets with the hashtag #unbonjuif (""a good Jew"").[277]","On February 20, 2012, a third-party public-key encryption app (written in Python and partially funded by a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation[278]) for private messaging in Twitter, CrypTweet, was released.[279]","On May 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement the ""Do Not Track"" privacy option, a cookie-blocking feature found in Mozilla's Firefox browser. The ""Do Not Track"" feature works only on sites that have agreed to the service.[280]","In August 2012, it was reported that there is a market in fake Twitter followers that are used to increase politicians' and celebrities' apparent popularity.[281] The black market for the fake followers, known as ""bots"", has been linked to ""nearly every politically linked account from the White House to Congress to the 2016 campaign trail"". In June 2014, POLITICO analyzed Twitter handles with the highest rates of fake followers: US President Barack Obama with 46.8 percent, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz with 35.1 percent, and Senator John McCain with 23.6 percent. The culprits working to generate the fake followers, or ""bots"", include campaign workers or friends of political candidates. One site offers 1,000 fake followers for $20. The people creating the ""bots"" are often from Eastern Europe and Asia.[282][283] In 2013, two Italian researchers calculated 10 percent of total accounts on Twitter are ""bots"" however, other estimates have placed the figure even higher.[284]","In April 2013, Twitter warned news organizations around the world to secure their Twitter accounts after a number of high-profile hacks of official accounts, including those of the Associated Press and The Guardian.[285] In May 2013, Twitter announced a two-factor login verification as an added measure against hacking.[286]","In August 2013, Twitter announced plans to introduce a ""report abuse"" button for all versions of the site. A petition for making the process of complaining about harassment easier had collected over 100,000 signatures. The move followed the posting of abusive tweets, including rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard, British feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and the British MP Stella Creasy.[287][288][289] Three men were arrested under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in connection with the incidents.[290]","In August 2014, Twitter said that in certain cases it would delete pictures of people who had died after requests from family members and ""authorized individuals"". The move followed controversy over the sharing of images on Twitter showing the killing of American journalist James Foley.[291][292]","In December 2014 Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies;[293][294][295][296] a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper, a target of GamerGate, also received notable coverage.[297][298][299]","In February 2015, in an internal Twitter memo, CEO Dick Costolo said he was 'frankly ashamed' at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse, and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result.[300]","Per an updated terms of service and privacy policy, Twitter users outside of the United States are legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter Inc., effective May 18, 2015. The change make these users subject to Irish and European data protection laws.[301]","Twitter has a history of both using and releasing open source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service.[302] A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used, from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala.[303] Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager.[304] The popular Twitter Bootstrap web design library was also started at Twitter and is the second most popular repository on GitHub.[305]","On April 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement an ""Innovators Patent Agreement"" which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes. The agreement went into effect in 2012.[306]",,"t.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter.[154] It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not available for general use.[154] All links posted to Twitter use a t.co wrapper.[307] Twitter hopes that the service will be able to protect users from malicious sites,[154] and will use it to track clicks on links within tweets.[154][308]","Having used the services of third parties TinyURL and bit.ly,[309] Twitter began experimenting with its own URL shortening service for private messages in March 2010 using the twt.tl domain,[307] before it purchased the t.co domain. The service was tested on the main site using the accounts @TwitterAPI, @rsarver and @raffi.[307] On September 2, 2010, an email from Twitter to users said they would be expanding the roll-out of the service to users. On June 7, 2011, Twitter announced that it was rolling out the feature.[155]","On June 1, 2011, Twitter announced its own integrated photo-sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from Twitter.com.[310] Users now also have the ability to add pictures to Twitter's search by adding hashtags to the tweet.[311] Twitter also plans to provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third-party services such as TwitPic.[311]","A Twitterbot is a computer program that automatically posts on Twitter, they are programmed to tweet, retweet, and follow other accounts. According to a recent report, there were 20 million, fewer than 5%, of accounts on Twitter that were fraudulent in 2013. These fake accounts are often used to build large follower populations quickly for advertisers, while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase.[312] Twitter's wide-open application programming interface and cloud servers make it possible for twitterbots' existence within the social networking site.[313]","Twitter is recognized for having one of the most open and powerful developer APIs of any major technology company.[314] Developer interest in Twitter began immediately following its launch, prompting the company to release the first version of its public API in September 2006.[315] The API quickly became iconic as a reference implementation for public REST APIs and is widely cited in programming tutorials.[316]","From 2006 until 2010, Twitter's developer platform experienced strong growth and a highly favorable reputation. Developers built upon the public API to create the first Twitter mobile phone clients as well as the first URL shortener. Between 2010 and 2012, however, Twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community.[317] In 2010, Twitter mandated that all developers adopt OAuth authentication with just 9 weeks of notice.[318] Later that year, Twitter launched its own URL shortener, in direct competition with some of its most well-known 3rd-party developers.[319] And in 2012, Twitter introduced strict usage limits for its API, ""completely crippling"" some developers.[320] While these moves successfully increased the stability and security of the service, they were broadly perceived as hostile to developers, causing them to lose trust in the platform.[321]","In an effort to reset its relationship with developers, Twitter acquired Crashlytics on January 28, 2013 for over USD $100 million, its largest acquisition to date.[322] Founded by Jeff Seibert and Wayne Chang, Crashlytics had rapidly gained popularity as a tool to help mobile developers identify and fix bugs in their apps.[323] Twitter committed to continue supporting and expanding the service.[324]","In October 2014, Twitter announced Fabric, a suite of mobile developer tools built around Crashlytics.[325] Fabric brought together Crashlytics, Answers (mobile app analytics), Beta (mobile app distribution), Digits (mobile app identity and authentication services), MoPub, and TwitterKit (login with Twitter and Tweet display functionality) into a single, modular SDK, allowing developers to pick and choose which features they needed while guaranteeing ease of installation and compatibility. By building Fabric on top of Crashlytics, Twitter was able to take advantage of Crashlytics' large adoption and device footprint to rapidly scale usage of MoPub and TwitterKit. Fabric reached active distribution across 1 billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch.[326]","In early 2016, Twitter announced that Fabric was installed on more than 2 billion active devices and used by more than 225,000 developers. Fabric is recognized as the #1 most popular crash reporting and also the #1 mobile analytics solution among the top 200 iOS apps, beating out Google Analytics, Flurry, and MixPanel.[327][328]","Twitter has been used for a variety of purposes in many industries and scenarios. For example, it has been used to organize protests, sometimes referred to as ""Twitter Revolutions"",[330] which include the 2011 Egyptian revolution, 2010–2011 Tunisian protests, 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, and April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election protests. A result of the Iranian election protests saw the government of Iran block Twitter in censorship.[331]","In August 2016, Twitter stated that it had banned 235,000 accounts over the past six months, bringing the overall number of suspended accounts to 360,000 accounts in the past year, for violating policies banning use of the platform to promote extremism.[332]","In February 2011, Paul Payack and Edward Peters wrote on The Hill that Twitter, and other social media, are a ""strategic weapon ... which have the apparent ability to re-align the social order in real time, with little or no advanced warning.""[333]","During the Arab Spring in early 2011, the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased.[334] A study by the Dubai School of Government found that only 0.26% of the Egyptian population, 0.1% of the Tunisian population and 0.04% of the Syrian population are active on Twitter.[335]","The service is also used as a form of civil disobedience: in 2010, users expressed outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the Spartacus film and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they cancelled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.[336]","Another case of civil disobedience happened in the 2011 British privacy injunction debate, where several celebrities who had taken out anonymized injunctions were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored.[337]",The Boston Police tweeted news of the arrest of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.[338],"Twitter has been used by Somalia's al-Shabaab rebels, who had their accounts suspended after they used the site to claim responsibility for an attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi in September 2013.[339][340]","In January 2016, Twitter was sued by the widow of a U.S. man killed in the Amman shooting attack, claiming that allowing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to continually use the platform, including direct messages in particular,[341] constituted the provision of material support to a terrorist organization, which is illegal under U.S. federal law. Twitter disputed the claim, stating that ""violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and, like other social networks, our rules make that clear.""[342][343] The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, upholding the Section 230 safe harbor which dictates that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by its users.[343][344] The lawsuit was revised in August 2016, providing comparisons to other telecommunications devices.[341]","On May 31, 2016, Twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that satirized Russian politics, sparking protests and raising questions about where the company stands on freedom of speech.[345] Following public outcry, Twitter restored the accounts the next day without answering why the accounts were suspended.[346] The same day, Twitter, along with Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review ""[the] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech"" posted on their services within 24 hours.[347]","In July 2016, Twitter removed the account of technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart News, citing racist[348] abuse against Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones.[349] Yiannopoulos, however, felt he was banned for being a gay conservative.[350] This was followed in November 2016 by the suspension of high-profile ""white supremacy movement"" user account of the white supremacist[351] Richard B. Spencer, his National Policy Institute account and his account, RadixJournal.[349]","On December 10, 2016, white supremacist Richard B. Spencer's personal Twitter account was re-instated.[352]","Twitter is banned completely in Iran, China and North Korea,[353] and has been intermittently blocked in numerous countries including Egypt, Iraq, Turkey and Venezuela on different bases.[354][355][356][357] In 2016, Twitter cooperated with the Israeli government to remove certain content originating outside Israel from tweets seen in Israel.[358]","On February 9, 2016, Twitter announced the creation of the ""Twitter Trust & Safety Council"".[359] The stated aim of this council is ""...to ensure that people feel safe expressing themselves on Twitter"". The 50 ""Inaugural Members"" of the council that were named in the announcement consisted almost entirely of persons or progressive organizations who have advocated the censorship of hate speech on the Internet.[360]","After claims in the media that the hashtags #wikileaks and #occupywallstreet were being censored because they did not show up on the site's list of trending topics, Twitter responded by stating that it does not censor hashtags unless they contain obscenities.[361][362][363]","In 2016, at the same time as Twitter executives paid to attend a political fundraiser by Hillary Clinton, the Twitter platform banned a pro-Bernie Sanders account that had started a hashtag critical of Clinton's fundraising from wealthy donors.[364]","In May 2008, The Wall Street Journal wrote that social networking services such as Twitter ""elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their early adopters. Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends. But some users are starting to feel 'too' connected, as they grapple with check-in messages at odd hours, higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they're having for dinner.""[365] The following year, John C. Dvorak described Twitter as ""the new CB radio"".[366]","A practical use for Twitter's real-time functionality is as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.[367]",Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter's ability to track epidemics and how they spread.[368],"In addition, Twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires.[369][370]","Twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research[371] settings mostly in colleges and universities.[372][373] It has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions, especially in large-lecture courses.[374] Research has found that using Twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty, promotes informal learning, allows shy students a forum for increased participation, increases student engagement, and improves overall course grades.[375][376][377]","Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 that using Twitter for ""literate communication"" is ""about as likely as firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad"".[378] In September 2008, the journalist Clive Thompson mused in a The New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into ""a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world"".[379] One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis.[380] Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints,[381] and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that ""the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful.""[382]","The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called ""Some Contemporary Characters,"" composed entirely of tweets.[383]","In 2009, Nielsen Online reported that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent. Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users.[384] In 2009, Twitter won the ""Breakout of the Year"" Webby Award.[385][386] During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition, the journalist Daniel Schorr stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact-checking and other editorial improvements. In response, Andy Carvin gave Schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on Twitter and said users wanted first-hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories.[387] On November 29, 2009 Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor, declaring it ""a new form of social interaction"".[388] Time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its 2010 Time 100; to determine the influence of people, it used a formula based on famous social networking sites, Twitter and Facebook. The list ranges from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey to Lady Gaga and Ashton Kutcher.[389][390] The U.S. government, seeing social media's role in the 2010 Arab Spring revolts, covertly developed a Cuban alternative to Twitter called ZunZuneo as part of a long-term strategy to ""stir unrest"". The service was active from 2010 to 2012.[391]","During the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared at the London Olympic Stadium in person,[392] Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, tweeted ""This is for everyone"",[393] which was instantly spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.[392]","World leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy, the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens. US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian.[394] On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the London Science Museum's Information Age exhibition.[395] A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts.[396] The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.[396]","According to an analysis of accounts, the heads of state of 125 countries and 139 other leading politicians have Twitter accounts that have between them sent more than 350,000 tweets and have almost 52 million followers. However, only 30 of these do their own tweeting, more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts.[397]","More than twenty Roman Catholic cardinals manage active Twitter accounts,[398] nine of whom were cardinal electors for the 2013 Papal conclave.[399] Pope Benedict XVI's Twitter account was set up in 2012. As of April 2016, his successor, Pope Francis, has 9.06 million followers of his Twitter account (@Pontifex).[400] In 2014, astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson caused a controversy among conservative Christians with a Christmas tweet celebrating the birth of Isaac Newton.[401]","Twitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture, products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication.[402] The New York Times states, ""They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs.""[403] The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot. The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, ""people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating them as if they were real people or real places."" The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere.[404] While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.[405]","In addition to content generating bots, users can purchase followers, favorites, retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a user's image through accumulation of followers. With more followers, users' profiles gain more attention, thus increasing their popularity.[406] Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability.[407] With Twitterbots, users are able to create the illusion of ""buzz"" on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms.[402][407] The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people, some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real. This practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on Twitter.[408] The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities, politicians, musicians, public figures, and companies alike.[409] According to The New York Times, bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections, influence the stock market, public appeal, and attack governments.[410]","According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published in July 2014, the United Kingdom's GCHQ has a tool named BIRDSONG for ""automated posting of Twitter updates"", and a tool named BIRDSTRIKE for ""Twitter monitoring and profile collection"".[411][412]","Twitter is also increasingly used for making TV more interactive and social.[413] This effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen, ""virtual watercooler"" or social television—the practice has been called ""chatterboxing"".[414] Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events, such as the Oscars, the Super Bowl[415] and the MTV Video Music Awards; however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows.[416] Such direct cross-promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising.[417]","In December 2012, Twitter and Nielsen entered a multi-year agreement to produce social TV ratings, which are expected to be commercially available for the fall 2013 season as the Nielsen Twitter TV Rating.[418][419] Advertising Age said Twitter had become the new TV Guide.[420] Then in February 2013, Twitter acquired Bluefin Labs for an estimated US$50 million to $100 million. Founded in 2008 at the MIT Media Lab, Bluefin is a data miner whose analysis tells which brands (e.g., TV shows and companies) are chatted about the most in social media.[418][419][421] MIT Technology Review said that Bluefin gives Twitter part of the US$72 billion television advertising market.[422]","In April 2013, the Associated Press' Twitter account was briefly hacked into, sending out a message that US president Barack Obama had been injured in an attack on the White House. Stocks lost $134 billion in value almost instantly, before recovering in value when it was discovered the report was false.[423]","In May 2013, it launched Twitter Amplify—an advertising product for media and consumer brands.[424] With Amplify, Twitter runs video highlights from major live broadcasts, with advertisers' names and messages playing before the clip.[425] Then in October 2013, Comcast announced a partnership with NBCUniversal and Twitter, to allow users to tune into live streaming from their set-top box, smartphone or tablet by tapping a 'See It' button embedded in selected tweets.[426]","In an attempt to compete with Twitter's leadership in TV, Facebook introduced a number of features in 2013 to drive conversation about TV including hashtags, verified profiles and embeddable posts. It also opened up new data visualization APIs for TV news and other media outlets, enabling them to search for a word and see a firehose of public posts that mention it as well as show how many people mentioned a word in both public and private posts during a set time frame, with a demographic breakdown of the age, gender, and location of these people.[427] In January 2014, Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time. Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV.[428] However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later. These acquisitions, as well as a partnership with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013) strengthened Twitter's dominance of the ""second screen"" – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media. With the additional analytic tools, Twitter was able to improve the firm's offering to advertisers, allowing them to, for instance, only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme.[429]","By February 2014, all four major U.S. TV networks had signed up to the Amplify program, bringing a variety of premium TV content onto the social platform in the form of in-tweet real-time video clips.[430] In March 2014, ITV became the first major broadcaster in the UK to sign up to Twitter Amplify[431] and Twitter introduced one-tap video playback across its mobile apps to further enhance the consumer experience.[432]","In June 2014, Twitter acquired its Twitter Amplify partner in the U.S., SnappyTV, as part of its ongoing efforts to be the leader in social television.[433] The company was helping broadcasters and rights holders to share video content both organically across social and via Twitter's Amplify program.

Timberlake reveals, ""I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R&B singer.""[147] On the influences he drew from, he said that if Justified was ""characterized"" by Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, FutureSex/LoveSounds is more like David Bowie and Prince.[148] Other influences include late INXS-frontman Michael Hutchence,[149] Arcade Fire, David Byrne, The Killers, The Strokes, and Radiohead.[146] He began including beatboxing in his records near the end of his boyband era and into his emergence as a solo act,[150] this includes songs from Justified[151] and FutureSex/LoveSounds.[152]","Unlike his previous record primarily focused on R&B and pop genres,[153] FutureSex/LoveSounds is less concentrated on one particular sound, thus representing a wider range.

Britney_Spears,"Britney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, dancer, and actress. Born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears's first and second studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), became international successes, with the former becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.[1] Title tracks ""...Baby One More Time"" and ""Oops!... I Did It Again"" broke international sales records. In 2001, Spears released her self-titled third studio album, Britney, and played the starring role in the film Crossroads (2002). She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003), which yielded the worldwide success of the single ""Toxic"".","In 2007, Spears's much-publicized personal issues sent her career into hiatus. Her fifth studio album, Blackout, was released later that year, and spawned singles such as ""Gimme More"" and ""Piece of Me"". Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations continued through the following year, at which point she was placed under a still ongoing conservatorship. Spears's sixth studio album, Circus (2008), included the international chart-topping single ""Womanizer"". Her seventh studio album, Femme Fatale (2011), became her first to yield three top-ten singles in the United States. She released her eighth studio album Britney Jean in 2013. Later that year, Spears began the four-year residency show, Britney: Piece of Me, at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. In 2016, Spears released her ninth studio album, Glory. In 2017, she announced that her residency show would develop into a world tour, Britney: Live in Concert.","Spears is regarded as a pop icon and credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s. She became the 'best-selling teenage artist of all time'[2] and garnered honorific titles including the ""Princess of Pop"".[3] Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, six MTV Video Music Awards including the Lifetime Achievement Award, seven Billboard Music Awards including the Millennium Award[4] and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2009, Billboard ranked her as the 8th overall Artist of the Decade,[5] and also recognized her as the best-selling female artist of the 2000s, as well as the fifth overall.[6] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) lists Spears as the eighth top-selling female artist in the United States, with 34 million certified albums.[7] She has sold over 100 million records worldwide[8] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. According to Billboard Spears has sold about 22.38 million singles in digital downloads in US and is the fourth best-selling female artist since Nielsen SoundScan began.[9]","Rolling Stone recognized her instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments of all time,[10] while VH1 ranked her eleventh on their ""100 Greatest Women in Music"" list in 2012,[11] and Billboard named her the sexiest woman in music.[12] Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of 2012, with earnings of $58 million, having last topped the list in 2002.[13]",,,"Spears was born in McComb, Mississippi, the second child of Lynne Irene Bridges and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese.[14][15] Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn.[16] At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.[17][18][19] Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing ""What Child Is This?"" at her kindergarten graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, ""I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age"".[18]","At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia for an audition in the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's vocals and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials.[20][21] In December 1992, she was finally cast in The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell, but returned to Kentwood after the show was canceled in 1996. She enrolled at Parklane Academy in McComb, Mississippi. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to ""the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.""[18][22]","In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and ""there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.""[23]","Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.[23] Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that ""it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that.""[18] She then sang Houston's ""I Have Nothing"" (1992) for the executives, and was signed to the label.[24] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from ""lower and less poppy"" delivery to ""distinctively, unmistakably Britney.""[25] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned ""Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary"" but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since ""It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me."" She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.[18]","After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her debut album.

Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.[28] It became the biggest selling album ever by a teenage artist.[19]","The title track was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final idea of a Catholic schoolgirl.[25] The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million as of today, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.[29][30] ""...Baby One More Time"" later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[31] The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.[32] It would later become the 25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history.[33] Spears is also the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the country.[34] ""(You Drive Me) Crazy"" was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and propelled ...Baby One More Time to sell even more. As of today, it has sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is also the best-selling first album by any artist ever.[35]","The April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone featured Spears lying on her bed, covered with a bra, shorts and an open top. The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as ""a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality"" and called to ""God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums."" Spears responded to the outcry commenting, ""What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time.""[36] Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a virgin until marriage.[19] On June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining ...Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics,[37] but generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.[38] An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000.

I Did It Again"", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations.[34][42] The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[43]","The same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!...

While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.[47] The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 12 million copies worldwide.[34][48][49] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney ""the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.""[50] The album was honored with two Grammy nominations—Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for ""Overprotected""— and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly's ""100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years"".[51][52] The album's first single, ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", became a top-ten hit worldwide.[53]","Spears's performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger and a large albino python draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.[45] To support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pièce de résistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.[54][55] The tour grossed $43.7 million, becoming the second highest grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher's Farewell Tour.[56] Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.[57] Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002.

In December 2002, Timberlake released the song ""Cry Me a River"" as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him.[63][64] As a response, Spears wrote the ballad ""Everytime"" with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani.[65] The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that ""I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.""[66]","In 2003 Spears opened the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing ""Like a Virgin"".

Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.[73] During 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.[74]","In July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[19] The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[75] Shortly after, she released her first fragrance with Elizabeth Arden, Curious, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[19] In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.[76] Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004.[77] Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's ""My Prerogative"" was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway.[78] The second single, ""Do Somethin'"", was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries of mainland Europe.[79][80] The greatest hits album sold over 5 million copies worldwide.[81] In August 2005, Spears released ""Someday (I Will Understand)"", which was dedicated to her first child, a son, who was born the following month.[82] In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of eleven remixes.[83] It has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[84]","In February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.[19] The following month, she guest-starred on the Will & Grace episode ""Buy, Buy Baby"" as closeted lesbian Amber Louise.[85] She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in June 2006, explaining, ""my baby is my religion.""[74] Two months later, Spears posed nude for the cover of Harper's Bazaar. The picture was heavily compared to Demi Moore's August 1991 Vanity Fair cover.[19] In September 2006, she gave birth to her second child, a son.[86] In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences.[87] Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the couple reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.[88]","Spears's aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007.[89] In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day.

The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public.[92] Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video ""Do Somethin'"" for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.[93]","In October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout.

She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold.

[...] Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability.""[234] Producer William Orbit, who collaborated with Spears on her album Britney Jean, stated regarding her vocals: ""[Britney] didn't get so big just because [she] put on great shows; [she] got to be that way because [her voice is] unique: you hear two words and you know who is singing"".[235]","Spears has cited her major influences in her career as being Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Whitney Houston, her ""three favorite artists"" as a child whom she would ""sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room""; Houston's ""I Have Nothing"" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.[236] Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Jackson in particular, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence. According to Spears: ""I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was.""[237] In the 2002 book Madonnastyle by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: ""I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna.""[238]","After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: ""she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.""[239] Madonna said of Spears in the documentary Britney: For the Record: ""I admire her talent as an artist [...] There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career"".[240] She has also named Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Otis Redding, Shania Twain, Brandy, Natalie Imbruglia, Justin Timberlake, Prince, Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande as sources of inspiration.[241][242][243][244][245][246][247]","Spears became an international pop culture icon immediately after launching her recording career. Rolling Stone magazine wrote: ""One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century,"" she ""spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop ... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank"".[248] She is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the ""Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist"" for her debut album ...Baby One More Time which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.[249] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported: ""She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist.

I Did It Again"", the singer appeared behind a backlit screen, and descended a spiral staircase and started performing ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"", while wearing a tuxedo.[255] After performing a shortened version of the track, she tore the tuxedo off, revealing a skin-tight flesh-coloured outfit.[256] The following year, Spears performed her single ""I'm a Slave 4 U"". Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized the performance, saying, ""draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting – surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits – Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.""[257]","She also duetted ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" with pop singer Michael Jackson at his 30th anniversary concert a few days earlier.[258] During the opening of the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards on August 28, 2003, Spears joined Madonna, Christina Aguilera, and Missy Elliott.[259] Halfway through the performance, Madonna kissed Spears and Aguilera on the lips.[260] The kiss between Spears and Madonna generated strong reaction from the media.[261] This performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[262] MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moments in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.[263]","Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote: ""Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry"".[264]","In 2011, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly commented on the cultural significance of Spears's voice and music: ""We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer...we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. Musically, though, Spears will always have to measure up to her own gold standards of pop euphony: the operatic slither of 2004's 'Toxic' and the candied funk of 2000's 'Oops!...I Did It Again.' Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson's yips or Eminem's snarls.""[265] 'Britney Spears' was Yahoo!'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.[266] Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009.[267] She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000 – 2009.[268]","Spears has been cited as a musical inspiration by contemporary artists. Gwyneth Paltrow's character in 2010 drama film Country Strong was inspired on the singer's public meltdown. According to film director Shana Fest, ""that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.""[269] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears as a major influence on her career, and commented, ""the fact that she came back out with just so much fire inspires me, and it inspires young women and people all over the world. It just inspires you. A lot of my fans feel like they are the underdog and feel like they are the people who aren't ever accepted for themselves, or who are laughed at or poked fun at forever. It just goes to show that once you keep at whatever it is you're doing, people may not like you, people may not love you, but they will have to respect you at the end of the day. And that respect is all that matters.""[270]","Lana Del Rey said: ""I'm not really interested in a ton of female musicians but there is something about Britney that compelled me – the way she sings and just the way she looks.""[271] Del Rey also said that the music video for ""Toxic"" inspires her.[272] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears ""taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her.""[273] Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her ""the most provocative performer of my time"".[274] Miley Cyrus credits Spears as her biggest inspiration, and has referenced the singer in her hit song ""Party in the U.S.A.""

Really, it's a beautiful thing.""[294] Simon Cowell explained that he is ""fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about – not just pop stars – but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. [...] She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that.""[295] Jessica Jung and Hyoyeon of the Korean girl group Girls' Generation have also been compared to Spears, due to their blonde hair and the latter's abilities as a dancer.[296]","Marina and the Diamonds named Spears as the main influence behind her album Electra Heart, stating that, ""I think people thought I was joking about that for a long time. But when I was a teenager there was a genuine connection with this sweet girl who also had this very sexual side that people didn't really want to accept [...] Britney is really smart. And in the way that she inspired Electra Heart, if you step back from all the cynical stuff, it actually focuses on the idea of innocence being mixed with darkness. For some reason I really like that combination. I suppose because you don't really connect innocence with darkness.""[297] Diamandis has also stated that Spears is her main influence when it comes to popular culture and that Spears is one she aspired to being growing up.[298]","Spears has had a direct influence on singer Porcelain Black's work after growing up around her music as a child.

Ronaldo later said that he grew up in poverty, sharing a room with his brother and sisters.[7]","As a child, Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha, where his father was the kit man,[8] and later spent two years with local club Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[9][10] He subsequently moved to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's other youth players at the club's football academy.[9] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football.[11] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had ""disrespected"" him.[11] A year later, however, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[12] He underwent an operation in which a laser was used to cauterise the affected area of his heart; discharged from hospital hours after the procedure, he resumed training only a few days later.[13]","At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[14] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17, and under-18 teams, the B team, and the first team, all within one season.[9] A year later, on 7 October 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Moreirense, and scored two goals in their 3–0 win.[15] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[16][17] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing the winger, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.[18]","Ronaldo came to the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson in August 2003, when Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in Lisbon. His performance impressed the Manchester United players, who urged Ferguson to sign him.[19] Ferguson himself considered the 18-year-old ""one of the most exciting young players"" he had ever seen.[20][21] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[22]","Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season.[23] His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[24] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona, and David Beckham.[25][26] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo,[26] who stated that his goal was to establish himself among the world's best players within the next three years.[27] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, ""He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career"".[28]","""There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me.""","Ronaldo made his debut in the Premier League in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003, receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Nicky Butt.[30][31][32] His performance earned praise from George Best, who hailed it as ""undoubtedly the most exciting debut"" he had ever seen.[29] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[33] Three other league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[34][35] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a game in which he also received his first red card.[36] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 victory over Millwall in the FA Cup final, earning his first trophy.[37]","At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[38][39][40][41] After scoring four goals in United's run to the FA Cup final,[42][43][44][45] he played the full 120 minutes of the decisive match against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw, and scored his attempt in the lost penalty shootout.[46] Although not yet a prolific goalscorer, Ronaldo scored three braces during the next campaign, the 2005–06 season, scoring two goals each against Bolton Wanderers,[47] Fulham,[48] and Portsmouth.[49] He scored Manchester United's 1000th Premier League goal on 29 October, their only strike in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough.[50] Midway through the season, in November, he signed a new contract which extended his previous deal by two years to 2010, as he felt his time at the club was important for the development of his career.[51] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final victory over Wigan Athletic.[52]","During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a ""one-fingered gesture"" towards Benfica fans,[53] and was sent off in the Manchester derby—a 3–1 defeat—for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[54] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[55] Following a training ground fight in January 2006, the two again fought in May, with van Nistelrooy telling Ronaldo to ""go crying to your daddy"", a reference to Ronaldo's relationship with assistant manager Carlos Queiroz.[56] Van Nistelrooy was left on the substitutes' bench for the final game of the season against Charlton Athletic—a 4–0 victory in which Ronaldo scored his ninth league goal—and was subsequently sold by the club.[57][58] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[59][60] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[61][62] United, however, denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[63][64]","Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[65] it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball, and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[66] His upturn in form was showcased in November when he received a standing ovation from a section Blackburn Rovers supporters as he was substituted.[67] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa—a victory which put United on top of the league—Wigan Athletic, and Reading.[68][69][70] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[71][72]","At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first-ever goals in the competition, finding the net twice in a 7–1 victory over Roma.[73][74] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[75] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[76] He also helped United reach the FA Cup final, putting them 2–1 up against Watford,[77] but the decisive match against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[78] Ronaldo netted the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May 2007—his 50th goal for the club—as Manchester United claimed their first Premier League title in four years.[79] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player, and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[80][81] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[82] His club wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week (£31 million total) as part of a five-year contract extension with United.[83]","Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. His first goal of the season came against his former club, Sporting, with a header in the first group match of the Champions League.[84] He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him,[85][86] but still managed to score 13 league goals by the campaign's midway point.[87][88][89][90] At the end of 2007, four years after proclaiming his desire to become one of the world's best players, Ronaldo achieved his goal when he was named runner-up to Kaká for the Ballon d'Or, as voted for by sports journalists,[91] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, as determined by international managers and captains.[92]","""Ronaldo is better than George Best and Denis Law, who were two brilliant and great players in the history of United.""","Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for Manchester United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, bringing United up to the top of the Premier League table.[94] A month later, on 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton, and scored both goals of the match.[95] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, which bettered George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, thus setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[96] Ronaldo scored his final league goal of the season from the penalty spot in the title decider against Wigan on 11 May, as United claimed a second successive Premier League title.[97] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[98] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[99]","In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon, which helped United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate,[100] and, while playing as a striker, scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate victory over Roma.[101] Despite him missing a penalty in the first leg against Barcelona,[102] United eventually advanced to the final in Moscow, where they faced Chelsea.[103] His opening goal was negated by an equaliser as the match ended in a 1–1 draw, but although his penalty was saved in the shoot-out,[104] Manchester United emerged victorious.[105][106] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[107] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[108][109]","As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid,[110][111] United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[112][113] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as ""modern slavery"".[114] Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,[115][116] he remained at United for another year.[117][118][119] Ahead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, he underwent ankle surgery,[120] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks.[121] Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November,[122] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time.[123] Five days later, he received the third red card of his career when he was sent off against Manchester City.[124] At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan,[125] assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process.[126][127] He subsequently became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since George Best in 1968,[128][129] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.[130]","Ronaldo scored his first Champions League goal of the season, and his first since the final against Chelsea, in a 2–0 victory over Inter Milan, sending United into the quarter-finals.[131] His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[132] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[133][134] He scored twice against Arsenal, including a free kick from 39 yards, as United advanced to the final in Rome,[135] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.[136][137] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive Premier League title and a Football League Cup.[138][139] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[140] His final ever goal for Manchester United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.[141]","""I have nothing but praise for the boy. He is easily the best player in the world. His contribution as a goal threat is unbelievable. His stats are incredible. Strikes at goal, attempts on goal, raids into the penalty box, headers. It is all there. Absolutely astounding.""","Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee of £80 million (€94 million).[143] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[144][145] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[146][147] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7,[148] Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[149] which was presented to him by the former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[150]","Ronaldo made his debut in La Liga on 29 August 2009, against Deportivo La Coruña, and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid's 3–2 home win.[151] He scored in each of his first four league fixtures with the club, the first Madrid player to do so.[152] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[153] His strong start to the season, however, was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[154][155] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería, which also saw him miss a penalty.[156] Midway through the season, Ronaldo placed second in the running for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, behind Lionel Messi of Barcelona, Madrid's historic rivals. He finished the campaign with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in the Spanish competition.[157][158] His first season at Real Madrid ended trophyless.[159]","Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt for Real Madrid before the 2010–11 season.[148] His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[160] His haul concluded a goalscoring run of six consecutive matches—three in La Liga, one in the Champions League, and two for Portugal—totalling 11 goals, the most he had scored in a single month. Ronaldo subsequently netted further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal, and Málaga.[161][162][163] Despite his scoring rate, he failed to make the podium for the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or at the end of 2010, marking the only year during his time in Spain to date that he was not named one of the world's two best players.[164]","During a historical series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions in a single season. Although he failed to find the net during Madrid's eventual elimination in the Champions League semi-finals, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the Copa del Rey final, winning his first trophy in Spain.[165][166] Over the next two weeks, Ronaldo scored another four-goal haul against Sevilla,[167][168] a hat-trick against Getafe,[169] and a brace of free kicks against Villarreal, taking his league total to 38 goals, which equalled the record for most goals scored in a season held by Telmo Zarra and Hugo Sánchez.[170] His two goals in the last match of the season, against Almería, made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[171][172] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo consequently won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in two different leagues.[173] He ended his second season at Real Madrid with a total of 53 goals in all competitions.","During the following campaign, the 2011–12 season, Ronaldo surpassed his previous goalscoring feats to achieve a new personal best of 60 goals across all competitions.[174] His 100th goal for Real Madrid came at Camp Nou in the Supercopa de España, though Barcelona claimed the trophy 5–4 on aggregate.[175] He regained a place on the FIFA Ballon d'Or podium, as runner-up to Messi, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna, and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point.[176][177][178][179][180] Despite two goals from Ronaldo, Madrid were subsequently defeated by Barcelona 4–3 on aggregrate in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. He again scored twice, including a penalty, in the Champions League semi-finals against Bayern Munich, resulting in a 3–3 draw, but his penalty kick in the shootout was saved by Manuel Neuer, leading to Madrid's elimination.[181]","Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, as he helped Real Madrid win their first La Liga title in four years, with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante, further increasing Madrid's lead over Barcelona,[182] he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás.[183] Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season.[184] His final league goal of the campaign, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi,[185] and earned him the distinction of being the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season in La Liga.[186]","Ronaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the Supercopa de España, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg by the Portuguese, Madrid won the supercup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona.[187] Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a ""professional issue"" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid,[188] his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo La Coruña, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 victory over Ajax.[189] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou.[190] His performances in 2012 again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, finishing runner-up to four-time winner Messi.[191]","Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Real Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring a brace to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 victory over Real Sociedad on 6 January.[192][193] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clásico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[194] Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe.[195] Following hat-tricks against Celta Vigo and Sevilla,[196][197] he scored his 200th goal for Real Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against Málaga, reaching the landmark in just 197 games.[198] He helped Madrid reach the Copa del Rey final by scoring a brace in El Clásico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[199] a scoring streak twice as long as that of any other player in Madrid's history.[187] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 defeat to Atlético Madrid,[200] but was shown a straight red card in the 114th minute for violent conduct.[201][202] Real Madrid also failed to defend their La Liga title, finishing runners up to Barcelona.","In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at the Santiago Bernabéu,[203] he netted the match-winning goal in a 2–1 victory at Old Trafford, his first return to his former home grounds;[204] afterwards, he commented that he felt sadness at having caused United's elimination from the competition.[205] Ronaldo scored three goals in Madrid's 5–3 aggregate victory over Galatasaray to see them advance to the semi-finals,[206][207] He scored Madrid's only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund,[208] but failed to increase his side's 2–0 victory in the second leg, as they were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year.[209] Ronaldo had scored 12 goals, finishing as the Champions League top goalscorer for a second time in his career. Accounting for all competitions, he ended the season with a total of 55 goals.","Real Madrid's failure to win major silverware and reports of division among the players prompted speculation regarding Ronaldo's future at the club.[210][211][212] At the start of the 2013–14 season, however, he signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of €17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football.[213][214] He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of €100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior.[215] Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed BBC, an acronym of Bale, Benzema, and Cristiano.[216] After enjoying a strong goalscoring run during the first half of the campaign, Ronaldo suggested that he was in the best form of his career.[217] By late November, he had scored 32 goals from 22 matches played for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden.[218][219][220][221][222] He ended 2013 with a total of 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally.[223] His efforts earned him the FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career, though the media vote favoured Franck Ribéry.[224][225] The achievement fuelled public recognition of Ronaldo as one of the greatest players in football history.[226][227][228]","Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Real Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup. In the knockout phase of the competition, he scored a brace in each leg of a 9–2 aggregate win against Schalke 04,[229] helping Madrid advance to the quarter-finals. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Borussia Dortmund—his 100th Champions League match—took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before.[230][231][232] After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena,[233] he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final victory over Atlético Madrid, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[234] His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: ""In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks.""[235] As the Champions League top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[236][237] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[238]","In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring a brace of penalties against Atlético Madrid at the Vicente Calderón,[239] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.[240] His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final,[235][241] where Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy.[242] While Madrid were less successful in La Liga, finishing third, Ronaldo was unmatched as a goalscorer. He scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez.[243] Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before.[244] A last-minute, backheeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May—his 50th goal in all competitions—was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga de Fútbol Profesional,[245][246] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.[247]","""Cristiano Ronaldo is changing the game in Spain. With all that pace and power and athleticism, he is driving Real Madrid back into dominance both there and in Europe.""","During the next campaign, the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals in all competitions, starting with both goals in Real Madrid's 2–0 victory over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[249][250] He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with a record 15 goals in the first eight rounds of La Liga, including a four-goal haul against Elche and hat-tricks against Deportivo La Coruña and Athletic Bilbao.[251][252][253][254] His record 23rd hat-trick in La Liga, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in the Spanish league, as he reached the milestone in only his 178th game.[254][255] After lifting the FIFA Club World Cup with Madrid in Morocco,[256] again winning the Silver Ball,[257][258] Ronaldo received a second successive FIFA Ballon d'Or,[259][260] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten as a three-time Ballon d'Or winner.[261][262]","Following the winter break, Ronaldo's form faltered, concurrently with a decline in performance by his team.[263] A 2–1 defeat against Valencia in the first match of 2015, despite his opening goal, ended Real Madrid's Spanish record winning streak of 22 matches in all competitions.[264] Their season continued unsuccessfully as they failed to win a major trophy, earning a second-place league finish and a semi-final exit in Europe.[265] In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2–0 win against Schalke 04,[266] before hitting a brace in the 3–4 return defeat that allowed Madrid to progress to the quarter-finals.[267] He then scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 2–3 on aggregate.[268] With 10 goals, he finished the campaign as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[269]","In La Liga, where Madrid finished second, Ronaldo went on a prolific goalscoring run towards the very end of the season. For the first time in his career, he scored five goals in one game, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada on 5 April.[270] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano.[271] Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol, and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Real Madrid to 31, surpassing Di Stéfano's club record of 28 trebles.[249][272] As a result, Ronaldo finished the season with 48 goals, two ahead of his total in the 2011–12 season, despite having missed two matches in February for assaulting a Córdoba player.[273] In addition to a second consecutive Pichichi, he won the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[249][274]","At the start of his seventh season at Real Madrid, the 2015–16 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6–0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous recordholder, Raúl.[275][276] A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals.[note 1] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.[279] A brace against Malmö, netted in a 2–0 away win on 30 September, saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for both club and country.[280][281] He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malmö.[282][283]","Despite finishing runner-up to Messi for the FIFA Ballon d'Or,[284] Ronaldo received criticism for his form and performances against top teams, with 14 of his goals coming against Espanyol and Malmö.[285][286] During the second half of the season, however, his form gradually improved.[287] By scoring four goals in a 7–1 home win over Celta Vigo on 5 March 2016, Ronaldo arrived at 252 goals in La Liga to become the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi.[288] After netting the match-winning goal for 10-man Madrid in a 2–1 Clásico victory on 2 April,[289] he scored a hat-trick against Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals despite a 2–0 first-leg defeat.[290] The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall.[291] Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atlético Madrid, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured La Undécima, Madrid's 11th victory.[292][293] For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored more than 50 goals across all competitions.[292] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.[294]","""The boy lived for the game – everything else was built to fit around it""","On 6 November 2016, Ronaldo signed a new contract which will keep him until 2021 with Madrid.[296] On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 away win against Atlético Madrid, making him the all-time top-scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals.[297][298] On 15 December 2016, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal (377 goals for Madrid, 118 goals for Manchester United and 5 goals for Sporting Lisbon) in the 2–0 victory over Club América in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup.[299] He then scored a hat-trick in the 4–2 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final.[300] Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named the best player of the tournament.[301] He won the Ballon d'Or for a fourth time and the inaugural Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the old-style FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his triumph with Portugal at the European Championship.[302] On 15 January, Ronaldo tied Hugo Sánchez as the most prolific penalty-kick scorer in the history of La Liga, with his 56th penalty from 65 attempts in a 2–1 loss to Sevilla, which ended Real Madrid's 40 match unbeaten streak in all competitions.[303][304] In Real Madrid's 3–2 away win against Villarreal on 27 February 2017, Ronaldo overtook Hugo Sánchez as the most prolific penalty-kick scorer in La Liga history.[305][306] Thanks to the penalty scored by Ronaldo, Real Madrid reached its 5,900th goal in the history of the league and became the first team to do so.[307] On 12 April 2017, in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarterfinal against Bayern Munich, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 2–1 away win to give Real the win and the lead going into the second leg. The two goals saw him make history in becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.[308] During the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a perfect hat-trick and reached his 100th UEFA Champions League goal becoming the first player to do so as Real Madrid again defeated Bayern 4–2 after extra-time.[309] On 2 May 2017, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick in the following Champions League game, as Real beat local rivals Atlético Madrid 3–0 in the semi-final first leg. His hat-trick made him the first player to reach 50 goals in the knock-out stage of the competition. [310]","A Portuguese international, Ronaldo began his youth career in 2001. Apart from the under-15 team, he also represented the under-17, under-20, under-21, and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.[311] He represented his country at the 2002 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, where they failed to progress past the group stage.[15] Ronaldo also featured in the Olympic squad at the 2004 Summer Olympics, scoring one goal in the tournament, though the team was eliminated in the first round, finishing bottom of their group with three points after 4–2 defeats to eventual semi-finalists Iraq and quarter-finalists Costa Rica.[312][313]","At age 18, Ronaldo earned his first senior cap in a 1–0 victory over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003.[314] He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country,[315] and scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece.[316] After converting his penalty in a shootout against England at the quarter-final stage,[317] he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands,[318] but the crucial last match ended in a 0–1 defeat.[319] He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.[320][321]","Ronaldo was the second-highest scorer in the European qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals.[321] During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage.[322] In the quarter-finals against England, his Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction,[323] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal.[324] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France.[325] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[326]","Post World Cup, one day after his 22nd birthday, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007,[327] as requested by Portuguese Football Federation president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier.[328] Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time.[329] While he scored eight goals in the qualification,[330] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic, where he was named man of the match.[331] Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3–2 loss against eventual finalists Germany.[332]","After Portugal's unsuccessful performance in the European Championship, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United.[333] Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008.[334] Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia.[335] At the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches against Côte d'Ivoire, North Korea, and Brazil.[336][337][338] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 rout of North Korea,[339] which marked his first international goal in 16 months.[340] Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.[341]","Ronaldo scored seven goals in the qualification for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a ""group of death"".[342] After the opening 0–1 defeat to Germany, he also failed to score in the 3–2 win against Denmark, missing two clear one-on-one chances,[343][344] which led to criticism from his countrymen for underperforming.[345] He redeemed himself in the last group match against the Netherlands, where he scored twice to secure a 2–1 victory,[346] and the quarter-finals against the Czech Republic, scoring a header to give his team a 1–0 win.[347][348] He was named man of the match against both opponents.[349][350] After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, with Ronaldo having sent three shots over the bar,[351] Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shootout. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth,[352] a decision that drew criticism.[353][354][355] As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.[356]","During the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals.

But we don't.""[366] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice,[367][368] Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, though he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat.[369] After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States,[370] he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Ghana.[371] His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups.[372] Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.[371]","Ronaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016.[373][374][375][376] With the only goal in another victory over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer.[377] At the start of the tournament, however, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking a total of 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Luís Figo as his nation's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half.[378] With two goals and an assist in the last match of the group stage, a 3–3 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament.[379][380] Though placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format.[381]","""Cristiano is sacrificing himself, he's working a lot for the team; he's not angry. When he doesn't score he's usually angry, but not now. He works a lot, also defending. You can see he's an authentic leader.""","In Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1–0 victory late in extra time.[383] After his team progressed past Poland on penalties,[384] Ronaldo became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals;[385] he scored the opening goal and assisted a second in a 2–0 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with 9 goals.[386] In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet; after multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the field and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Éder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1–0 victory.[387] As team captain, Ronaldo later lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first-ever triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.[388][389]","""I admire him [Ronaldo], if I had to set up a national team he would be my first pick.""","Following the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo scored four goals against Andorra in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on 8 October 2016. His four goals against a nine-man team marked the highest amount of goals he has scored in an international match.[391][392] On 13 November, Ronaldo scored two goals (while also missing a penalty) in another qualifier against Latvia, which ended in a 4–1 home victory; these goals brought his international tally to 68 goals, putting level with Gerd Müller and Robbie Keane as the fourth-highest European international goalscorer of all-time.[393] He played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at the age of 32, opening a 2–3 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Estádio dos Barreiros; with the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.[394]","A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[395] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[396] He ranks among the world's fastest footballers, both with and without the ball.[397] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility, and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[397][398] such as the step overs that became his trademark.[399]","As Ronaldo matured, he underwent a major physical transformation, developing a muscular body type that allows him to retain possession of the ball.[400] His strength, combined with his elevation and height of 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in), awarded him an edge in winning aerial challenges for balls; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[398][401] Concurrently with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing, where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He also increasingly played a creative role for his team, participating in build-up plays courtesy of his good vision and passing ability.[397]","In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[402] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot.[142][402][403] An accurate penalty kick taker,[404] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks,[405] though his ability in this regard deteriorated later on in his career.[406][407]","At Real Madrid, he continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited.[402] Initially deployed as a centre-forward, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role, allowing him to drift into the centre at will.[408][409] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats.[410] From 2013 onwards, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, instead focusing on short-distance goalscoring.[399]","""In the six years [Manchester United] had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player.""","Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi,[412][413] and as one of the best players to ever play the game.[414] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goalscoring ability, he is considered a decisive player, who stands out in games and who can be a game changer.[415] Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic and dedication to improvement on the training field.[416] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to carve his name in history alongside football players such as Pelé and Diego Maradona.[417]","Ronaldo has at times been criticised for diving when tackled, about which his former Real Madrid manager José Mourinho responded: ""Cristiano is a player who does not have the culture of the swimming pool, he has no culture of simulation, he is a British-trained player, Ferguson trained. In some cases, the simulators are given more protection, and those who are honest are often the losers. I'm not a hypocrite if I say that they [defenders] hit Cristiano very hard, and that the yellow cards do not arrive or are slow in coming"".[418] Despite his talent, he was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[419][420]","Earlier in his career, Ronaldo had also been described as having an ""arrogant image"" on the field, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a ""victim"", because of how he was portrayed in the media.[421] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[421] His managers, teammates and various journalists have commented that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[422][423][424][425][426] In 2014, Ronaldo told France Football that he had made a ""mistake"" when he said in 2011, ""People are jealous of me as I am young handsome and rich"", adding that he had matured since then and fans understood him better.[427]","Both players have scored in two UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50 goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football.[428] It has been compared to sports rivalries such as the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis, and the Ayrton Senna-Alain Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[429][430]","""It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent.""","Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two,[432] while part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players: Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[433][434][435][436]","In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying ""I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high"",[437] while Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, Alex Ferguson, opined that ""I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best"".[438] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was ""only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano"".[439] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented; ""We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players"", before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating; ""We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.""[431] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players face each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which had a global audience of 400 million viewers in March 2014.[440]","In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming ""one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other"". Real Madrid demanded – and promptly received – a full apology, and the Portuguese issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla, after Blatter had described him as a ""commander"" on the pitch.[441]","Forbes has twice ranked Ronaldo first on their list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and off-field earnings was $73 million in 2013–14 and $79 million in 2014–15.[442][443] The latter earnings saw him listed behind only boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr. on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes.[444] In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[445] Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable athletes: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012,[446] and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013, with Brazilian footballer Neymar topping both lists.[446][447] Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014.[448] He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world.[449] In June 2016, ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete.[450]","As his reputation grew from his time at Manchester United, Ronaldo signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including e.g. sportswear (he wears Nike Mercurial Vapor CR7 boots), soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, computer video games, and much more.[451][452][452][453][454][455][456]","Ronaldo has established a strong online presence; the most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted 158 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by June 2015.[457] As of June 2015, he has the world's biggest Facebook fanbase with 103 million followers:[457] he became the first sportsperson to reach 50 million followers in August 2010,[458] and in October 2014, he became the first sportsperson, and the second person after Shakira, to reach 100 million followers.[459] He is also the most-followed athlete on Twitter with 37.8 million followers as of September 2015,[460] and is the most-followed footballer on Instagram with 33.6 million followers as of October 2015.[461] Ronaldo has released two mobile apps: in December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive,[462] and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and mobile app.[463] Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.[464]","Ronaldo's life and person have been the subject of several works.

The lawsuit never went to trial but a settlement was reached by use of a mediator in 2012; the exact settlement is unknown.[61]","In March 2012, Kardashian debuted her fourth fragrance, titled ""True Reflection"", which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote.[62] That month, Kardashian and her sisters were named in a $5 million class action lawsuit against QuickTrim, the weight loss supplement they endorse.[63] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accuses the Kardashians (along with QuickTrim's manufacturer, Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain) of false and deceptive marketing of the diet aid. The plaintiffs, hailing from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[64] In April, E! renewed Keeping Up with the Kardashians for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.[65][66] In October 2012, Kardashian released her fifth fragrance, ""Glam"", which ""draws on the glamour of her Hollywood lifestyle"", and was made available through Debenhams.[67]","In summer of 2012, Kardashian and her family filmed a music video in the Dominican Republic to Notorious B.I.G's song ""Hypnotize"".[68]","Kardashian appeared on the cover, and in a pictorial in Paper's winter issue in 2014 photographed by Jean-Paul Goude.[69] On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: ""Break the Internet"", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media.[70][71] The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera.[72][73] A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and ""trying to tear down"" barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was ""just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us what it is like to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise.""[74] However, the stunt ""set a new benchmark"" in social media response,[75] and Paper's website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.[76][77]","Kardashian voiced the role of an alien in an episode of the adult animated series American Dad!, in season 11 (2014–15) in the episode titled ""Blagsnarst, A Love Story"" on September 21, 2014. In the episode, her character crash-lands in the town of Langley Falls. The alien then develops an attraction to her fellow alien Roger.[78][79]","In June 2014, Kardashian released a mobile game for iPhone and Android called Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The objective of the game is to become a Hollywood star or starlet.[80] The game supports a free to play model, meaning the game is free to download, but charges for in game-items.[81] The game was a hit, earning US$1.6 million in its first five days of release.[81] In July, the game's developer Glu Mobile announced that the game was the fifth highest earning game in Apple's App Store.[81]","In April 2015, Kardashian and West traveled to the Armenian Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem to have their daughter, North, baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church. The ceremony took place at the Cathedral of St. James.[82] Khloe Kardashian was appointed the godmother of North.[83]","In May 2015, Kardashian released a portfolio book called 'Selfish', a 325-page collection of self-taken photos of herself.[84] In December 2015, Kardashian released an emoji pack for IOS devices called Kimoji.[85] The paid app quickly became a top earner for Apple, becoming one of the top 5 most bought apps that week.[85]","In August 2015, Kardashian was the cover model for Vogue Spain.[86]","On October 2, 2016, while attending Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in the apartment where she was staying. Five individuals, dressed as police officers, bound and gagged her, then stole $10 million worth of jewelry.[87] The thieves got in her residence by threatening the concierge. Once they accessed Kardashian's room, they held a gun to her head, tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape around her mouth as a gag.[88] Kardashian, who was placed in the bathtub, was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life.[89][90][91] She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped.[92] On October 6, 2016, it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed ""on hold indefinitely"" after the robbery.[93] Production resumed on October 26.[94] Kardashian postponed a makeup demonstration in Dubai due to the incident.[95]","Kardashian will make a cameo appearance in Ocean's Eight set for release on June 8, 2018.[96][97]","Kardashian is one of the many celebrity turned entrepreneurs who are able to leverage their television success by launching profitable side businesses. Kardashian is the founder of the television production company, Kimsaprincess Productions LLC which produces workout DVDs, launched an eponymous fragrance line and the e-commerce shoe shopping website, ShoeDazzle. With her sisters Kourtney and Khloe, she also owns and is expanding D-A-S-H clothing boutiques, designed a clothing line for Bebe and nabbed diet (Quick Trim) and skincare (PerfectSkin) products endorsements.[98][99]","In 2006, Kardashian entered the business world with her two sisters and opened the boutique shop D-A-S-H in Calabasas, California.[33] In 2007, Kardashian and three partners Brian Lee, Robert Shapiro and MJ Eng founded ShoeDazzle, an online shoe and accessories website. The site now boasts more than 3 million customers, who pay a monthly fee for access to a personalized selection of shoes, jewelry and handbags every month. The site also landed a $40-million investment from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.[100] The company is valued at $280 million as of 2012.[101][102][103][104] In March 2009, she launched an endorsement with her company, ShoeDazzle shopping,[105] of which she is the co-founder and chief fashion stylist.[43] She then endorsed multiple other projects including a vanilla cupcake mix flavor called 'Va-Va-Va-Nilla' for the bakery, Famous Cupcakes.[43]","Beginning in early 2010, Kardashian and her sisters designed and developed clothing lines for Bebe stores and 'Virgins, Saints, and Angels'.[106][107][108] In April 2010, Kardashian and her sisters released a sunless tanner ""Kardashian Glamour Tan"", that month.[109] In October 2011, Kardashian and her sisters opened their Kardashian Khaos store in Las Vegas.[110] In November 2012, Kardashian and her sisters internationally launched the 'Kardashian Kollection' in England,[111][112] as well as launching a line of cosmetics, 'Khroma Beauty'.[113]","In 2000, 19-year-old Kardashian eloped with music producer Damon Thomas.[114] Thomas filed for divorce in 2003. Kardashian later credited their separation to physical and emotional abuse on his part.[115] Prior to the completion of her divorce, Kardashian began dating singer Ray J.[114]","In May 2011, Kardashian became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.[116] They were married in a wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[117] Earlier that month, she had released her ""wedding fragrance"" called ""Kim Kardashian Love"" which coincided with her own wedding.[39][118] A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a ""media blitz"" related to the wedding.[119] After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences.[120] Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt, to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[121] A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived marriage was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and subsequently settled the case which included an apology from Jaxson.[122] A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.[123] The divorce was subject to widespread media attention.[124]","Kardashian began dating American rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April 2012, while still legally married to Humphries.[125] Her divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013,[126] while Kardashian gave birth to her first child with West, daughter North West, on June 15, 2013.[127] Kardashian and West became engaged on October 21, Kardashian's 33rd birthday,[128] and married on May 24, 2014 at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.[129] Her wedding dress was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy[130] with some guests' dresses designed by designer Michael Costello.[131] Kardashian gave birth to her second child, son Saint West, on December 5, 2015.[132] The couple's high status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as ""a historic blizzard of celebrity.""[5]","As of May 2014, Kardashian was estimated to be worth US$45 million.[133] In 2015, Forbes reported she had ""made more this year than ever as her earnings nearly doubled to $53 million from 2014's $28 million,"" and reported that she ""has monetized fame better than any other.""[134] Much of her income include wholesale earnings of the Sears line, the Kardashian Kollection, which raked in $600 million in 2013 and the Kardashian Beauty cosmetics line, Kardashian-branded tanning products, the boutique-line DASH, as well as sponsored Instagram and Twitter posts which are collectively worth $10,000-25,000 per post.[135]","Kardashian has expressed pride in her Armenian and Scottish ancestry,[136][137] although she is not a citizen of either country and cannot speak Armenian.[138] She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide on numerous occasions, and encouraged President Barack Obama and the United States government to consider its acknowledgement.[139][140][141]","In April 2015, she traveled to Armenia with her husband, her sister Khloé and her daughter North and visited the memorial of the victims in Yerevan.[142] In April 2016, Kardashian wrote an article on her website condemning The Wall Street Journal for running an advertisement denying the Armenian Genocide.[143] During an interview with GQ for the July 2016 issue, Kardashian described herself as a Liberal Republican, fiscally conservative but socially progressive.[144]",Teen Choice Awards,Other awards,"A ^ Jenner changed her name to Caitlyn due to gender transition in 2015.[175]

CNN,"The Cable News Network (CNN) is an American basic cable and satellite television news channel owned by the Turner Broadcasting System division of Time Warner.[1] It was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel.[2] Upon its launch, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage,[3] and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.[4]","While the news channel has numerous affiliates, CNN primarily broadcasts from the Time Warner Center in New York City, and studios in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta is only used for weekend programming. CNN is sometimes referred to as CNN/U.S. (or CNN Domestic[5]) to distinguish the American channel from its international sister network, CNN International. As of August 2010, CNN is available in over 100 million U.S. households.[6] Broadcast coverage of the U.S. channel extends to over 890,000 American hotel rooms,[6] as well as carriage on cable and satellite providers throughout Canada. Globally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories.[7]","CNN has also been accused of having a left-wing bias, most notably during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election between now 45th U.S. President Donald Trump (who has targeted the network multiple times) and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.[8]","As of February 2015, CNN is available to about 96,289,000 cable, satellite, and telco television households (82.7% of households with at least one television set) in the United States.[9]",,,"The Cable News Network was launched at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 1, 1980. After an introduction by Ted Turner, the husband and wife team of David Walker and Lois Hart anchored the channel's first newscast.[10] Burt Reinhardt, the executive vice president of CNN at its launch, hired most of the channel's first 200 employees, including the network's first news anchor, Bernard Shaw.[11]","Since its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to a number of cable and satellite television providers, several websites, and specialized closed-circuit channels (such as CNN Airport). The company has 42 bureaus (11 domestic, 31 international),[12] more than 900 affiliated local stations (which also receive news and features content via the video newswire service CNN Newsource),[13] and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world.[14] The channel's success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner[15] and set the stage for conglomerate Time Warner's eventual acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.[16]","A companion channel, CNN2, was launched on January 1, 1982[17] and featured a continuous 24-hour cycle of 30-minute news broadcasts.[18] The channel, which later became known as CNN Headline News and is now known as simply HLN, eventually focused on live news coverage supplemented by personality-based programs during the evening and primetime hours.","On January 28, 1986, CNN carried the only live television coverage of the launch and subsequent break-up of Space Shuttle Challenger, which killed all seven crew members on board. All other major broadcast stations had stopped airing the scene live before the break-up, and subsequently returned to airing it with taped relays.[19]","On October 14, 1987, Jessica McClure, an 18-month-old toddler, fell down a well in Midland, Texas. CNN quickly reported on the story, and the event helped make its name.[20] The New York Times ran a retrospective article in 1995 on the impact of live video news:","If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a moving picture is worth many times that, and a live moving picture makes an emotional connection that goes deeper than logic and lasts well beyond the actual event. This was before correspondents reported live from the enemy capital while American bombs were falling. Before Saddam Hussein held a surreal press conference with a few of the hundreds of Americans he was holding hostage. Before the nation watched, riveted but powerless, as Los Angeles was looted and burned. Before O. J. Simpson took a slow ride in a white Bronco, and before everyone close to his case had an agent and a book contract. This was uncharted territory just a short time ago.[21]","The first Persian Gulf War in 1991 was a watershed event for CNN that catapulted the channel past the ""Big Three"" American networks for the first time in its history, largely due to an unprecedented, historical scoop: CNN was the only news outlet with the ability to communicate from inside Iraq during the initial hours of the Coalition bombing campaign, with live reports from the al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad by reporters Bernard Shaw, John Holliman and Peter Arnett.","The moment when bombing began was announced on CNN by Bernard Shaw on January 16, 1991, as follows:[22]","This is Bernie Shaw. Something is happening outside. ... Peter Arnett, join me here. Let's describe to our viewers what we're seeing... The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated. ... We're seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky.","Because it was unable to immediately broadcast live pictures from Baghdad, CNN's coverage of the initial hours of the Gulf War had the dramatic feel of a radio broadcast – and was compared to legendary CBS news anchor Edward R. Murrow's gripping live radio reports of the German bombing of London during World War II.[23] Despite the lack of live pictures, CNN's coverage was carried by television stations and networks around the world, resulting in CNN being watched by over a billion viewers worldwide.[24]","The Gulf War experience brought CNN some much sought-after legitimacy and made household names of previously obscure reporters. In 2000, media scholar and director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, Robert Thompson, stated that having turned 20, CNN was now the ""old guard.""[25] Bernard Shaw, known for his live-from-Bagdhad reporting during the Gulf War, became CNN's chief anchor until his retirement in 2001.[26][27] Others include then-Pentagon correspondent Wolf Blitzer (now host of The Situation Room) and international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Amanpour's presence in Iraq was caricatured by actress Nora Dunn in the role of the ruthless reporter Adriana Cruz in the 1999 film Three Kings. Time Warner-owned sister network HBO later produced a television movie, Live from Baghdad, about CNN's coverage of the first Gulf War.","Coverage of the first Gulf War and other crises of the early 1990s (particularly the infamous Battle of Mogadishu) led officials at the Pentagon to coin the term ""the CNN effect"" to describe the perceived impact of real time, 24-hour news coverage on the decision-making processes of the American government.",CNN was the first cable news channel to break the news of the September 11 attacks.[28] Anchor Carol Lin was on the air to deliver the first public report of the event. She broke into a commercial at 8:49 a.m. Eastern Time that morning and said:,"This just in. You are looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there. That is the World Trade Center, and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center. CNN Center right now is just beginning to work on this story, obviously calling our sources and trying to figure out exactly what happened, but clearly something relatively devastating happening this morning there on the south end of the island of Manhattan. That is once again, a picture of one of the towers of the World Trade Center.","Sean Murtagh, CNN vice president of finance and administration, was the first network employee on the air. He called into CNN Center from his office at CNN's New York City bureau and reported that a commercial jet had hit the Trade Center.[29]","Daryn Kagan and Leon Harris were live on the air just after 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time as the second plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center and through an interview with CNN correspondent David Ensor, reported the news that U.S. officials determined ""that this is a terrorist act.""[30] Later, Aaron Brown and Judy Woodruff anchored through the day and night as the attacks unfolded, winning an Edward R. Murrow award for the network.[31] Brown had just joined CNN from ABC to serve as the breaking news anchor.","Paula Zahn assisted in the September 11, 2001, coverage on her first day as a CNN reporter, a fact that she mentioned as a guest clue presenter on a 2005 episode of Jeopardy!.","CNN has made archival files of much of the day's broadcast available in five segments, plus an overview.","Leading up to the 2008 U.S. presidential election, CNN devoted large amounts of its coverage to politics, including hosting candidate debates during the Democratic and Republican primary seasons. On June 3 and 5, CNN teamed up with Saint Anselm College to sponsor the New Hampshire Republican and Democratic Debates.[32] Later in 2007, the channel hosted the first CNN-YouTube presidential debates, a non-traditional format where viewers were invited to pre-submit questions over the internet via the YouTube video-sharing service.[33] In 2008, CNN partnered with the Los Angeles Times to host two primary debates leading up to its coverage of Super Tuesday.[34] CNN's debate and election night coverage led to its highest ratings of the year, with January 2008 viewership averaging 1.1 million viewers, a 41% increase over the previous year.[34]",CNN again devoted large amounts of coverage to the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Chief political correspondent Candy Crowley acted as moderator for one of the three debates between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. Conservatives viewed her as overly partisan/biased due to her attempts at correcting statements by Mitt Romney on the 2012 Benghazi consulate attack.[35],"Driven by live coverage of the year's US presidential election, 2016 was CNN's most-watched year in its history.[36] Throughout the campaign, the network aired unedited coverage of many of the Trump campaign rallies. Aides for Republican candidates Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz accused CNN president Jeff Zucker of undermining their candidates during the Republican primaries.[37] Zucker acknowledged that it had been a mistake to air so many of the campaign rallies.[38] CNN also drew criticism during the election for hiring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was still being paid by and was effectively working on behalf of the campaign.[39]","At a January 11, 2017 press conference with Donald Trump, CNN reporter Jim Acosta was shouted down when he attempted to ask the President-elect a question. Trump took issue with the network's reporting on a dossier by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele and declared that the cable news network was ""fake news"".[40]","On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for over $80 billion. If approved by federal regulators, the merger would bring Time Warner's properties, including CNN, under the same umbrella as AT&T's telecommunication holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV.[41][42]","CNN's current weekday schedule consists mostly of rolling news programming during daytime hours, followed by in-depth news and factual programs during the evening and primetime hours.","The network's morning programming consists of Early Start, an early-morning news program hosted by Christine Romans and Dave Briggs at 4–6 a.m. ET, which is followed by New Day, the network's morning show, hosted by Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota at 6–9 a.m. ET. Most of CNN's late-morning and early afternoon programming consists of CNN Newsroom, a rolling news program hosted by John Berman and Poppy Harlow in the morning and Brooke Baldwin in the afternoon. In between the editions of Newsroom, At This Hour with Kate Bolduan at 11 a.m. to noon Eastern, followed by Inside Politics with John King, hosted by John King at noon Eastern, and Wolf with Wolf Blitzer at 1 p.m. Eastern.[43]","CNN's late afternoon and early evening lineup consists of The Lead with Jake Tapper, hosted by Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. Eastern and The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, hosted by Wolf Blitzer at 5–7 p.m. ET. The network's evening and primetime lineup shifts towards more in-depth programming, including Erin Burnett OutFront at 7 p.m. ET,[44] and Anderson Cooper 360° at 8–10 p.m. ET, followed by CNN Tonight with Don Lemon, hosted by Don Lemon at 10 p.m. to midnight Eastern.","The network's overnight programming consists of CNN International program CNN Newsroom, Monday at 2–4 a.m. ET, and Tuesday through Friday at 12–4 a.m. ET.","CNN launched new series in the 9p.m. ET timeslot for the 2014–15 season, such as John Walsh's The Hunt, This is Life with Lisa Ling, and Mike Rowe's Somebody's Gotta Do It. Jeff Zucker explained that this new lineup was intended to shift CNN away from a reliance on pundit-oriented programs, and attract younger demographics to the network. Despite this, Zucker emphasized a continuing commitment to news programming, as the 9 p.m. hour can be pre-empted as needed for expanded coverage of news events. These changes coincided with the introduction of a new imaging campaign for the network, featuring the slogan ""Go there"".[45][46][47] In May 2014, CNN premiered The Sixties, a documentary miniseries produced by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman which chronicled the United States in the 1960s. Owing to its success, CNN would produce sequels focusing on the 1970s and 1980s for 2015 and 2016 respectively.[48][49]","Weekend primetime is dedicated mostly to factual programming, including the reality series Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, along with topical documentaries and specials under banners such as CNN Presents, CNN Special Investigations Unit and CNN Films. The network's weekend morning programming consists of CNN Newsroom (simulcast from CNN International) at 4–6 a.m. ET, which is followed by the weekend editions of New Day, hosted by Christi Paul and Victor Blackwell, which airs every Saturday at 6–9 a.m. ET and Sunday at 6–8 a.m. ET and the network's Saturday program Smerconish with Michael Smerconish at 9 a.m. Eastern and replay at 6 p.m. Eastern. Sunday morning lineup consists primarily of political talk shows, including Inside Politics with John King, hosted by John King at 8 a.m. Eastern and State of the Union, hosted by Jake Tapper at 9 a.m. Eastern and replay at noon Eastern, and the international affairs program Fareed Zakaria GPS, hosted by Fareed Zakaria at 10 a.m. Eastern and replay at 1 p.m. Eastern, and the media analysis program Reliable Sources with Brian Stelter, hosted by Brian Stelter at 11 a.m. Eastern.",CNN began broadcasting in the high definition 1080i resolution format in September 2007.[50] This format is now standard for CNN and is available on all major cable and satellite providers.,"CNN's political coverage in HD was first given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007. The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the channel's CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.[51]","In December 2008, CNN introduced a comprehensive redesign of its on-air appearance, which replaced an existing style that had been used since 2004. On-air graphics took a rounded, flat look in a predominantly black, white, and red color scheme, and the introduction of a new box next to the CNN logo for displaying show logos and segment-specific graphics, rather than as a large banner above the lower-third. The redesign also replaced the scrolling ticker with a static ""flipper"", which could either display a feed of news headlines (both manually inserted and taken from the RSS feeds of CNN.com), or ""topical"" details related to a story.[52][53]","CNN's next major redesign was introduced on January 10, 2011, replacing the dark, flat appearance of the 2008 look with a glossier, blue and white color scheme, and moving the secondary logo box to the opposite end of the screen. Additionally, the network began to solely produce its programming in the 16:9 aspect ratio, with standard definition feeds using a letterboxed version of the HD feed.[53] On February 18, 2013, the ""flipper"" was dropped and reverted to a scrolling ticker; originally displayed as a blue background with white text, the ticker was reconfigured a day later with blue text on a white background to match the look of the 'flipper'.[54]","On August 11, 2014, CNN introduced its most recent graphics package, dropping the glossy appearance for a flat, rectangular scheme incorporating red, white, and black colors, and the Gotham typeface. The ticker now alternates between general headlines and financial news from CNNMoney, and the secondary logo box was replaced with a smaller box below the CNN bug, which displays either the title, hashtag, or Twitter handle for the show being aired or its anchor.[55] In April 2016, CNN began to introduce a new corporate typeface, known as ""CNN Sans"", across all of its platforms. Inspired by Helvetica Neue and commissioned after consultations with Troika Design Group, the font family consists of 30 different versions with varying weights and widths to facilitate use across print, television, and digital mediums.[56]","In August 2016, CNN announced the launch of its new initiative, CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting (CNN AIR). It is a drone-based news collecting operation to integrate aerial imagery and reporting across all CNN networks and platforms, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner entities.[57]","On July 27, 2012, CNN president Jim Walton announced that he was quitting, after a 30-year tenure at the network. Walton remained with CNN until the end of that year.[65] In January 2013, former NBCUniversal president Jeff Zucker replaced Walton.[66]","On January 29, 2013, longtime political analysts James Carville and Mary Matalin, and fellow political contributor Erick Erickson were let go by CNN.[67]","CNN launched its website, CNN.com (initially an experiment known as CNN Interactive), on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, social media and user-generated content have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late 2005.","In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S., according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.[68]","CNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or ""pipes""), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up ""news alerts"" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows. There was also a browser-based ""web client"" that did not require installation. The service was discontinued in July 2007, and was replaced with a free streaming service.","The topical news program Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005.[69] Blog coverage was expanded when Inside Politics was folded into The Situation Room (Inside Politics later returned to CNN in 2014, this time hosted by the network's chief national correspondent John King.[70]). In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech shootings sent-in first hand photos of what was going on during the shootings.[71]","In early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to cable and satellite subscribers who receive CNN at home (a precursor to the TV Everywhere services that would become popularized by cable and satellite providers beginning with Time Warner's incorporation of the medium).[72] CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the RealNetworks SuperPass subscription service outside the U.S. CNN also offers several RSS feeds and podcasts.","On April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the 2008 Tibetan unrest.

In 2014, CNN launched a radio version of their popular Television programming on TuneIn Radio.[80]","In April 2010, CNN announced via Twitter that it would launch a food blog called ""Eatocracy,"" which will ""cover all news related to food – from recalls to health issues to culture.""[81] CNN had an internet relay chat (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with Benjamin Netanyahu on the network in 1998.[82]","CNNHealth consists of expert doctors answering viewers' questions online at CNN's ""The Chart"" blog website.

It will produce 360 videos to its Android and iOS apps within CNN Digital.[84][85] It is planning to cover major news events with the online, and digital news team in New York City, Atlanta, London, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Dubai, Johannesburg, Tokyo, and Beijing.[86]","In October 2012, CNN formed a film division called CNN Films to distribute and produce made-for-TV and feature documentaries. Its first acquisition was a documentary entitled Girl Rising, a documentary narrated by Meryl Streep that focused on the struggles of girls' education.[87]","In July 2014, Cumulus Media announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate national and international news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015, including access to a wire service, and digital content for its station websites. This service is unbranded, allowing individual stations to integrate the content with their own news brands.[88]","Over the years, CNN has launched spin-off networks in the United States and other countries. Channels that currently operate as of 2014[update] include:","CNN has also launched television and online ventures that are no longer in operation, including:","CNN launched two specialty news channels for the American market which would later close amid competitive pressure: the sports news channel CNNSI shut down in 2002, while business news channel CNNfn shut down after nine years on the air in December 2004. CNN had a partnership with Sports Illustrated through the sports website CNNSI.com, but sold the domain name in May 2015.[92] CNNfn's former website now redirects to money.cnn.com, a product of CNN's strategic partnership with Money magazine. Money and Sports Illustrated were both Time Warner properties until 2014, when the company's magazine division was spun off into the separate Time Inc.","CNN operates bureaus in the following cities as of February 2017[update].[93] Boldface indicates that the city is home to one of CNN's original bureaus, meaning it has been in operation since the network's founding.","In parts of the world without a CNN bureau, reports from local affiliate station the network will be used to file a story.","In a joint study by the Joan Shorenstein Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by the three major cable channels of Republican and Democratic candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007:","The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates – by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain faring the worst (63% negative) and Romney faring a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. It's not that Democrats, other than Obama, fared well on CNN either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator's stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative. But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative, that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama.[94]","CNN is one of the world's largest news organizations, and its international channel, CNN International is the leading international news channel in terms of viewer reach.[95][96] CNN International makes extensive use of affiliated reporters that are local to, and often directly affected by, the events they are reporting. The effect is a more immediate, less detached style of on-the-ground coverage. This has done little to stem criticism, largely from Middle Eastern nations, that CNN International reports news from a pro-American perspective. This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a ""liberal"" or ""anti-American"" bias.","CNN President Walter Isaacson met with Republican Party leaders in Washington, DC in 2001 saying afterwards ""I was trying to reach out to a lot of Republicans who feel that CNN has not been as open covering Republicans, and I wanted to hear their concerns,""[97] As said by CNN founder Ted Turner, ""There really isn't much of a point getting some Tom, Dick or Harry off the streets to report on when we can snag a big name whom everyone identifies with. After all, it's all part of the business."" However, in April 2008, Turner criticized the direction that CNN has taken.[98] Others have echoed that criticism, especially in light of CNN's ratings declines since the late 2000s.","U.S. President Donald Trump openly referred to CNN as the ""Clinton News Network"" during the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference.

She's been through a lot, but she carries herself with a lot of class and I love that.""[238] Gomez's debut solo album Stars Dance (2013) was prominently influenced by Spears, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, and American electronic producer Skrillex.[239] Her sophomore album, Revival (2015), was mainly influenced by Christina Aguilera's album Stripped (2003) and singer Janet Jackson.[234][240]","Gomez has ventured into other businesses and industries.

Jimmy_Fallon,"James Thomas Fallon (born September 19, 1974) is an American comedian, television host, and musician. He is known for his work in television as a cast member on Saturday Night Live and as the host of late-night talk show The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. He was born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and raised in Saugerties, New York. He grew up with an interest in comedy and music, moving to Los Angeles at 21 to pursue stand-up opportunities.","He was commissioned to join NBC's Saturday Night Live as a cast member in 1998, fulfilling a lifelong dream. Fallon remained on SNL for six years between 1998 and 2004, co-hosting the program's Weekend Update segment and becoming a celebrity in the process. He left the program for the film industry, starring in films such as Taxi (2004) and Fever Pitch (2005). Following his film career, Fallon returned to television as the host of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on NBC in 2009, where he became well known for his emphasis on music and games. He moved from that program to become the sixth permanent host of the long-running The Tonight Show in 2014.","In addition to his television work, Fallon has released two comedy albums and five books.",,,"Fallon was born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, New York, and is the son of Gloria (née Feeley) and James W. Fallon.[1][2][3] Fallon's ancestry is five-eighths Irish, a quarter German, and one-eighth Norwegian; his paternal grandmother, Luise Schalla, was from Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany, while one of his maternal great-grandfathers, Hans Hovelsen, was an immigrant from Fredrikstad, Norway. Fallon's patrilineal ancestry originates with his great-great-grandparents, Thomas Fallon, who was from County Galway, Ireland, and Louisa Stickever (whose parents were Henry Stickever, who was born in France, of Irish descent, and Mary O’Brien, who was Irish).[4][5]","A Vietnam War veteran,[6] Fallon's father spent his adolescence singing in street-corner doo-wop groups, and shortly after his son's birth, was working as a machine repairman for IBM in Kingston, New York.[7] In preparation, the family relocated nearby to Saugerties, New York. Fallon has described his childhood as ""idyllic,""[8] while his parents have been noted as overprotective. He and his sister, Gloria, were unable to leave their home,[9] and they had to ride their bicycles in the backyard.[10]","Fallon attended St. Mary of the Snow, a Roman Catholic elementary school in Saugerties. He considered being a priest, inspired by his experiences as an altar boy.[10] He became more interested in comedy instead. He spent many nights recording the radio program The Dr. Demento Show on a reel-to-reel recorder, where he was exposed to both comedy and music.[8] Fallon developed an obsession with the late-night comedy program Saturday Night Live (SNL) as a teenager, watching it religiously.[11] He grew up watching the show, viewing ""the clean parts"" that his parents taped for him. He and Gloria would re-enact sketches like ""The Festrunk Brothers"" with friends.[11] Fallon was such a fan that he made a weekly event of watching the show in his dormitory during college.","In his teens, he impressed his parents with different impersonations, including actor James Cagney[12][13] and comedian Dana Carvey.[14] He was also musically inclined, and started playing guitar at age thirteen. He would go on to perform comedy and music in contests and shows.[13] By his junior high years, he was labeled a class clown, to his teachers' disdain, but also described as generally ""nice and well-mannered.""[15] At Saugerties High School, from which he graduated in 1992, he was a performer in most stage productions, and was twice a class social director.[15] He won a young comedian's contest with an impression of Pee-wee Herman.[11] He then attended The College of Saint Rose in Albany, New York, where he was first a computer science major, later switching to communications in his senior year. In May 2009, 14 years after he left college a semester early to pursue a comedy career, he was back to receive his Bachelor of Arts in communications. He was a double headliner that day at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, earning an honorary degree reflecting his achievements and then joining classmates to collect his degree. St. Rose awarded Fallon his diploma after he earned experiential learning credits through a portfolio review of his television work.[16] He was an average student, often taking stand-up gigs on the weekends.[8] Fallon would often board buses from his aunt's in Fort Hamilton to Caroline's comedy club in Times Square to perform sets.[17]","Fallon dropped out of The College of Saint Rose a semester shy of a degree to move to Los Angeles to pursue comedy full-time.[18] He secured a manager and got bookings by the age of 21.[19] He often did stand-up at the Improv, earning $7.50 per set,[6] and he joined classes with the Groundlings, an improv comedy troupe.[15] Fallon appeared in the feature film The Scheme (originally entitled The Entrepreneurs). His one line in Father's Day was cut, but he can still be seen in the background. In 1998, Fallon appeared briefly on the show Spin City in the second season as a man selling photographs.","He remained fixated on joining Saturday Night Live. After two years of working with the Groundlings,[20] he auditioned for the program in 1997, but was unsuccessful.[15] When he was cast in a pilot presentation for The WB, Fallon made sure to include a clause in his contract specifying that if he were to join SNL he would be released from his contract.[9] His manager sent videotapes to Marci Klein and Ayala Cohen, producers for SNL.[21]","Fallon landed his second audition at the age of 23. At the ""notoriously difficult audition,""[22] he was told by multiple individuals that creator Lorne Michaels almost never emitted laughter during auditions. Although he initially feared the comic before him, armed with an arsenal of props, would outshine him, Fallon went onstage and did well.[21] He showcased his impressions with a celebrity walk-a-thon, including impressions of Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Bill Cosby, and Adam Sandler, an SNL alumnus who had recently left the show.[23] The latter received laughter from the room, including Michaels.[24] Head writer Tina Fey, who was in the room, later said ""He's one of two people I’ve ever seen who was completely ready to be on the show. Kristen Wiig is the other one... And Jimmy was ready—like, if there had been a show to do that night.""[22] He rushed through his original characters in order to arrive at his musical impressions, which he felt were stronger. Three weeks passed, and despite his feeling that he had not gotten the position, he was asked to meet with Michaels at the Paramount lot in Los Angeles. Michaels informed him that they wanted him for the show, and Fallon characterized the moment as being in ""slow motion,"" remarking to Michaels before he left, ""I'm going to make you proud.""[21]","Fallon debuted on Saturday Night Live as a featured player at the beginning of the show's twenty-fourth season in September 1998.[25] He became a star by his fourth episode, when he performed Halloween-themed versions of songs by popular artists, as well as his Sandler impression.[9] His sudden popularity made Fallon a celebrity, where he was considered charming. Fallon possessed a strong female fan-base, receiving numerous letters from fans and becoming the subject of numerous fan-sites.[6] He became the program's most featured mimic, with popular impressions of Robert De Niro, Jerry Seinfeld, and Howard Stern. In addition, he also starred as many original characters, including Nick Burns, an IT Support nerd, Pat ""Sully"" Sullivan, one of the Boston Teens with Rachel Dratch, and in Jarret's Room, a fictional webcast hosted by stoner college students Jarret (Fallon) and Gobi (Horatio Sanz).","He was promoted to repertory player in his second season.[6] In his off time, Fallon released a book comprising e-mail exchanges with his sister, titled I Hate This Place: A Pessimist's Guide to Life (1999), and filmed a minor role for the film Almost Famous (2000).[6] During their time at SNL, Fallon and Horatio Sanz often drank together. Sanz has described Fallon and himself as ""super-functioning alcoholics,"" and stated, ""They say that kind of goes hand in hand with SNL, some kind of substance-abuse issues, because it's so stressful you easily find yourself blowing off steam a lot.""[17] For example, on one occasion, they spent a Friday night watching The Strokes perform a midnight show, staying up until the early morning drinking, despite having to do SNL that night.[26] ""We actually took what we thought being on SNL was, what people think is awesome about it, and we made it happen,"" said Sanz,[26] who noted that he and Fallon got in more than a few bar fights.[17]","Fallon initially envisioned he would spend three years at SNL, like Belushi, but he was persuaded to stay on for an additional three when given the reins to Weekend Update (which he would co-host with writer Tina Fey).[17][27] His co-hosting of Weekend Update increased his profile even more.[10] Tabloids often linked him to actresses Winona Ryder and Gina Gershon.[10] During this tenure, he formed a close relationship with Michaels, whom he'd consult with on anything from dating to career advice.[22] Fallon called a December 2001 sketch in which he imitates Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger in a mirror opposite Jagger his favorite thing he had done up to that point.[10] In his later years on SNL, Fallon co-starred in skit titled The Barry Gibb Talk Show alongside musician Justin Timberlake, where the duo portrayed Bee Gees brothers Barry and Robin Gibb. It marked the beginning of a long-running friendship and collaboration with Timberlake.[28]","Fallon became well known for his tendency to break character in sketches, an attribute he himself, as well as Michaels, disliked.[29] It began in the infamous ""More cowbell"" sketch, when Will Ferrell wore a tighter shirt than expected, causing Fallon to crack up. Following this, other cast members would intentionally try to get Fallon to break.[9] For example, Ferrell did this by squeezing his leg underneath the water in the ""Luvahs In A Hot Tub"" sketch.[9] Critics derided this tendency as an example of a secretly smug persona, or how unprofessional he was.[30] Other cast members believed he was attempting to steal the moment, to make the sketch about himself. The joke became near-constant during Fallon's final year on the show.[9] During this time, Fallon parlayed his SNL success into co-hosting the 2001 MTV Movie Awards[31] and 2002 MTV Video Music Awards,[32] and the recording on his debut comedy album, The Bathroom Wall (2002), which was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. He also modeled for Calvin Klein.[20] Fallon was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in 2002, an honor Fallon found embarrassing.[33]","Fallon began to pursue a movie career beginning in 2004. He had spurned most major roles due to lack of time and disinterest in the dozens of scripts he read.[15] He signed on for his first lead role in Taxi, a remake of a French film. Fallon had read the script in the prior years but became more interested when co-star Queen Latifah became attached to the project. He was also attracted to the film's action comedy tone, seeing comparisons with SNL alumnus Eddie Murphy's first big film, 48 Hrs. (1982).[34] He split his time in the fall of 2003 between shooting the film in Los Angeles and returning to New York City for SNL.[15] Due to these conflicts (and his contract ending), his sixth season at SNL was his final, with Fallon signing off at the conclusion of the show's twenty-ninth season in May 2004.[35]","With big expectations from the studio, Taxi premiered in the fall of 2004 and was a flop with critics and audiences, resulting in Fallon's first failure.[9] 20th Century Fox had already signed him on for his second major role, starring opposite Drew Barrymore 2005's romantic comedy Fever Pitch, before Taxi was unsuccessful.[15] Fever Pitch did not do much better, receiving mild reviews and tepid box office returns.[36] He met his wife, producer Nancy Juvonen, during production of the film and the two wed in December 2007. Film offers decreased, with his two chances for major films both considered failures. Subsequently, Fallon went through what he has deemed a ""lost period,"" characterized by a larger-than-usual alcohol consumption and confusion over his next career moves.[8] He wrote a screenplay during this time ""about a guy in a goth band who has to pretend to be a country-music star.""[9] Following his failure in film, Fallon moved back east to New York, spending ""a couple of years aimlessly knocking around.""[17]","Prior to leaving SNL, Michaels had mentioned to Fallon that he would be a good fit to take over NBC's Late Night franchise when then-host Conan O'Brien would depart the show to host the long-running Tonight Show in the future. Michaels urged NBC to give Fallon a holding deal in February 2007 so that he couldn't be lured elsewhere.[36] To prepare for the role of a late-night host, Fallon toured college campuses and comedy clubs for eight months, where he tested out a new, 50-minute routine.[37] He also began watching the comedy of Chevy Chase, Dick Cavett, and Johnny Carson, as well as The Larry Sanders Show.[9] In May 2008, Fallon was announced as the successor to O'Brien's Late Night.[38][39][40] Fallon was considered an odd choice for the job, both by executives at NBC (who ""hated"" the idea and predicted it to be a failure), and among the general public.[29] This was referenced in an early promo for the series: ""You loved him on SNL! You hated him in the movies! Now you're ambivalent.""[29][30]","Late Night with Jimmy Fallon premiered in March 2009 to mixed reviews. Producer Michael Shoemaker felt that the show's style solidified when it used Susan Boyle as a joke. While other late-night programs had centered on her appearance, Fallon's Late Night debuted a sketch in which Boyle's emotional performances could ""salve any affliction.""[30] It was this style of humor, that Adam Sternbergh of New York dubbed ""the comedy of unabashed celebration,""[30] that led to the program's success.","Fallon proved himself different from other late-night hosts, with more of a reliance on music, dancing, impersonations, and games.[9] Between Fallon's own musical sensibilities and the recruitment of his house band, hip-hop collective The Roots, his incarnation of Late Night ""evolved into the most deeply musical of TV’s musical-comedy variety programs"", with sketches in which he parodies Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen going viral online.[8] Coincidentally, it was during the Tonight Show debacle that Fallon's show found its footing.[8] Another component built into the program was its association with social media and the Internet. The first majorly successful online clip was of Fallon and Justin Timberlake performing a ""History of Rap"".[30] Online interaction and its presence on the show soon became crucial to its success.[41] As of August 2013, Fallon was earning a salary of $11 million a year for his work on Late Night.[42]","Fallon also hosted the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2010.[43][44] In 2012, Fallon released his second comedy album, Blow Your Pants Off, which compiles many of his musical performances on Late Night.[45] The album won a Grammy in 2013 for Best Comedy Album.[46] Discussions for Fallon to take over The Tonight Show began in early 2013.[47]","On April 3, 2013, following a period of speculation, NBC officially announced that Fallon would succeed Jay Leno to become the sixth permanent host of The Tonight Show following the 2014 Winter Olympics.[48][49] Fallon and Leno sang the ""Tonight""'s parody of Tonight Show together. Fallon's Tonight Show debut on February 17, 2014, on NBC's network engaged 11.3 million viewers.","Fallon's third book, Your Baby's First Word Will Be Dada, a children's book, was released in June 2015.[50][51]","On September 15, 2016, Fallon hosted Donald Trump on The Tonight Show during the United States presidential election.[52][53] After the appearance, Fallon was criticized by some media critics and viewers on social media for the uncontroversial questions he asked of Trump.[54][55] David Sims, writing in The Atlantic, called the interview an ""embarrassment.""[52] In response to the criticism, Fallon said to TMZ: ""Have you seen my show? I’m never too hard on anyone. We’ll have Hillary [Clinton] on tomorrow, and we’ll do something fun with her too.""[56]","Fallon told David Steinberg on the Showtime series Inside Comedy that as a child he and his sister would imitate Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd's ""Wild and Crazy Guys"" routines from Saturday Night Live, and that he listened to comedy records, learning to imitate Rodney Dangerfield from them.[57]","Fallon married film producer Nancy Juvonen, co-owner of production company Flower Films, on December 22, 2007.[58] After meeting on the set of Fever Pitch, Nancy and Jimmy began dating in May 2007 after Drew Barrymore invited Fallon to a birthday party she threw for Nancy. A few months later, Fallon proposed on the dock at sunset with a Neil Lane designed engagement ring in August 2007 at Nancy's family home in Wolfeboro on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. They were married four months later.[59] They have two daughters: Winnie Rose, born in 2013, and Frances Cole, born in 2014; both were born via gestational surrogacy.[60][61][62][63]","Fallon was raised in a Catholic family and, when he was a child, wanted to eventually become a priest.[64] He has a female English cream Golden Retriever dog named Gary Frick that has appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.[65][66][67]","On February 22, 2011, Fallon was on The Dr. Oz Show and had a mole removed from his left hand in front of a live studio audience by cosmetic surgeon Arthur Perry.[68][69]","On June 26, 2015, Fallon suffered a ring avulsion, an injury he suffered by tripping over a rug in his home and catching his ring on a counter top which nearly tore off his finger. He was taken to the emergency room and then sent to a surgeon who performed microsurgery on his finger. Fallon spent 10 days in the ICU before going home. He discussed this on the July 13 episode of the Tonight Show and thanked the doctors and nurses who helped him. As of July 14, 2015, he was expecting to spend another eight weeks without any feeling in his finger.[70] In an interview with Billboard magazine in September 2015, Fallon explained that his finger still had limited mobility and that another surgery would be required.[71] He reiterated this point at the 67th Emmy Awards on September 20, 2015, where he also appeared in public without his finger bandaged for the first time.[72]"
Shakira,"Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll (pronounced: [ʃaˈkiɾa isaˈβel meβaˈɾak riˈpol]; English /ʃəˈkɪərə/; born 2 February 1977)[2] is a Colombian singer, songwriter, dancer, and record producer. Born and raised in Barranquilla, she began performing in school, demonstrating Latin American, Arabic, and rock and roll influences and belly dancing abilities. Shakira's first studio albums, Magia and Peligro, failed to attain commercial success in the 1990s; however, she rose to prominence in Latin America with her major-label debut, Pies Descalzos (1996), and her fourth album, Dónde Están los Ladrones? (1998).","Shakira entered the English-language market with her fifth album, Laundry Service. Its lead single, ""Whenever, Wherever"", became the best-selling single of 2002. Her success was solidified with her sixth and seventh albums Fijación Oral, Volumen Uno and Oral Fixation, Volume Two (2005), the latter of which spawned one of the best-selling songs of the 21st century, ""Hips Don't Lie"". Shakira's eighth and ninth albums, She Wolf (2009) and Sale el Sol (2010), received critical praise. Her official song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, ""Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)"", became the biggest-selling World Cup song of all time. With over 1.3 billion views, it is one of the most-watched music videos on YouTube. Shakira served as a coach on the fourth and sixth seasons of the American version of The Voice in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Her tenth album, Shakira (2014), is preceded by its lead single, ""Can't Remember to Forget You"".","Shakira has won many awards, including five MTV Video Music Awards, two Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, 28 Billboard Latin Music Awards and has been Golden Globe-nominated. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and has sold between 70 and 125 million records worldwide (depending on the source),[3][4] making her the best selling South American singer and one of the best selling Latin artists of all time. She carries out well-known philanthropic activities through charity work most notably through her Pies Descalzos Foundation. In 2014, she was listed as the 58th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[5]",,,"Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll was born on 2 February 1977 in Barranquilla, Colombia. She is the only child of Nidia Ripoll Torrado and William Mebarak Chadid. Her paternal grandparents emigrated from Lebanon to New York City, where her father was born.[6][7][8][9] Her father then emigrated to Colombia at age 5. The name Shakira is Arabic (شَاكِرَة, šākirah), from which language it translates as ""grateful"". It is the feminine form of the name Shakir (شَاكِر, šākir). From her mother, she has Spanish (Catalan and Castilian)[10][11] and Italian[12] ancestry, although both of her mother's surnames are Spanish. She was raised Roman Catholic and attended Catholic schools.[13] She has eight older half-siblings from her father's previous marriage.[14] Shakira spent much of her youth in Barranquilla, a city located on the northern Caribbean coast of Colombia, and wrote her first poem, titled ""La Rosa De Cristal/The Crystal Rose"", when she was only four years old. As she was growing up, she was fascinated watching her father writing stories on a typewriter, and asked for one as a Christmas gift. She got that typewriter at the age of seven, and has continued writing poetry since then. These poems eventually evolved into songs. When Shakira was two years old, an older half-brother was killed in a motorcycle accident; six years later, at the age of eight, Shakira wrote her first song, titled ""Tus gafas oscuras/Your dark glasses"", which was inspired by her father, who for years wore dark glasses to hide his grief.[15]","When Shakira was four, her father took her to a local Middle Eastern restaurant, where Shakira first heard the doumbek, a traditional drum used in Arabic music and which typically accompanied belly dancing.[16] She started dancing on the table, and the experience made her realize that she wanted to be a performer. She enjoyed singing for schoolmates and teachers (and even the nuns) at her Catholic school, but in second grade, she was rejected for the school choir because her vibrato was too strong. The music teacher told her that she sounded ""like a goat"".[16][17] At school, she was often sent out of the class because of her hyperactivity.[18] She says she had also been known as ""the belly dancer girl"", as she would demonstrate every Friday at school a number she had learned.[16] ""That's how I discovered my passion for live performance,"" she says.[14][19] To instill gratitude in Shakira for her upbringing, her father took her to a local park to see orphans who lived there. The images stayed with her, and she said to herself: ""One day I'm going to help these kids when I become a famous artist.""[14]","Between the ages of 10 and 13, Shakira was invited to various events in Barranquilla and gained some recognition in the area.[20] It was at this approximate time that she met local theater producer Monica Ariza, who was impressed with her and as a result tried to help her career. During a flight from Barranquilla to Bogotá, Ariza convinced Sony Colombia executive Ciro Vargas to hold an audition for Shakira in a hotel lobby. Vargas held Shakira in high regard and, returning to the Sony office, gave the cassette to a song and artist director. However, the director was not overly excited and thought Shakira was something of ""a lost cause"". Undaunted and still convinced that Shakira had talent, Vargas set up an audition in Bogotá. He arranged for Sony Colombia executives to arrive at the audition, with the idea of surprising them with Shakira's performance. She performed three songs for the executives and impressed them enough for her to be signed to record three albums.[21]","Shakira's debut album, Magia, was recorded with Sony Music Colombia in 1990 when she was only 13 years old.[22] The songs are a collection made by her since she was eight, mixed pop-rock ballads and disco uptempo songs with electronic accompaniment; however, it was hampered by a lack of cohesion in both its recording and the production. The album was released in June 1991 and featured ""Magia"" and three other singles. Though it fared well on Colombian radio and gave the young Shakira much exposure, the album did not fare well commercially as only 1,200 copies were sold worldwide.[16] After the poor performance of Magia, Shakira's label urged her to return to the studio to release a follow-up record. Though then little known outside of her native Colombia, Shakira was invited to perform at Chile's Viña del Mar International Song Festival in February 1993. The festival gave aspiring Latin American singers a chance to perform their songs, and the winner was then chosen by a panel of judges. Shakira performed the ballad ""Eres"" (""You Are"") and won the trophy for third place. One of the judges who voted for her to win was the then 20 year old Ricky Martin,[22] whose initial prominence had come from his membership in Menudo.","Shakira's second studio album, titled Peligro, was released in March, but Shakira was not pleased with the final result, mainly taking issue with the production. The album was better received than Magia had been, though it was also considered a commercial failure due to Shakira's refusal to advertise or promote it. Shakira then decided to take a hiatus from recording so that she could graduate from high school.[22] In the same year, Shakira starred in the Colombian TV series The Oasis, loosely based on the Armero tragedy in 1985.[23] Since then, the albums have been pulled from release and are not considered official Shakira albums but rather promotional albums. Shakira originally recorded the song ""¿Dónde Estás Corazón?"" (later released on her album Pies Descalzos) for the compilation album Nuestro Rock in 1995, released exclusively in Colombia.[24] The album Pies Descalzos brought her great popularity in Latin America by the hit singles ""Estoy Aquí"", ""Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos"" and ""Dónde Estás Corazón"".[22] Shakira also recorded three tracks in Portuguese, titled ""Estou Aqui"", ""Um Pouco de Amor"", and ""Pés Descalços"".","Shakira returned to recording music under Sony Music along with Columbia in 1995 with Luis F. Ochoa, using musical influences from a number of countries and an Alanis Morissette-oriented persona which affected two of her next albums.[25] These recordings spawned her third studio album, and her major-label debut, titled Pies Descalzos. Recording for the album began in February 1995, after the success of her single ""¿Dónde Estás Corazón?"" Sony gave Shakira $100,000 to produce the album since they predicted that the album would not sell past 100,000 copies.","The album, Pies Descalzos, was released in February 1996. It debuted at number one in eight different countries. However, it only managed to reach number one-hundred-eighty on the U.S. Billboard 200 but reached number five on the U.S. Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. The album spawned six hit singles, ""Estoy Aquí"", which reached number two on the U.S. Latin chart, ""¿Dónde Estás Corazón?"" which reached number five on the U.S. Latin chart, ""Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos"" which reached number 11 on the U.S. Latin chart, ""Un Poco de Amor"" which reached number six on the U.S. Latin chart, ""Antología"" which reached number 15 on the U.S. Latin Pop Songs chart, and ""Se quiere, Se Mata"" which reached number eight on the U.S. Latin chart.[26] In August 1996, RIAA certified the album platinum status.[27]","In March 1996, Shakira went on to her first international tour, named simply the Tour Pies Descalzos. The tour consisted of 20 shows and ended in 1997. Also in that year, Shakira received three Billboard Latin Music Awards for Album of the Year for Pies Descalzos, Video of the Year for ""Estoy Aqui"", and Best New Artist.[28] Pies Descalzos later sold over 5 million copies,[29][30] prompting the release of a remix album, simply titled The Remixes. The Remixes also included Portuguese versions of some of her well-known songs, which were recorded as a result of her success in the Brazilian market, where Pies Descalzos sold nearly one million copies.[20]","Her fourth studio album was titled Dónde Están los Ladrones? This, produced entirely by Shakira herself and Emilio Estefan, Jr. as the executive producer, was released in September 1998. The album, inspired by an incident in an airport in which a suitcase filled with her written lyrics was stolen, became a bigger hit than Pies Descalzos. The album has reached a peak position of number 131 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and held the top spot on the U.S. Latin Albums chart for 11 weeks. It has since sold over seven million copies worldwide[31][32][clarification needed] and 1.5 million copies in the U.S. alone, making it one of the best selling Spanish albums in the U.S. Eight singles were taken from the album including ""Ciega, Sordomuda"", ""Moscas En La Casa"", and ""No Creo"", which became her first single to chart on the U.S. Billboard Billboard Hot 100, ""Inevitable"", ""Tú"", ""Si Te Vas"", ""Octavo día"", and the ""Ojos Así"". The latter two songs won Shakira one Latin Grammy each, with six of the eight singles reaching the top 40 on the U.S. Latin chart.","Shakira also received her first Grammy Award nomination in 1999 for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album.[33] Shakira's first live album, MTV Unplugged was recorded in New York City on 12 August 1999. Highly acclaimed by American critics, it is rated as one of her best-ever live performances.[34] The live album earned the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 2001 and gained sales of five million worldwide. In March 2000, Shakira embarked on her Tour Anfibio, a two-month tour of Latin America and the United States. In August 2000, she won an MTV Video Music Award in the category of People's Choice — Favorite International Artist for ""Ojos Así"". In September 2000, Shakira performed ""Ojos Así"" at the inaugural ceremony of the Latin Grammy Awards, where she was nominated in five categories: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for MTV Unplugged, Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for ""Octavo Día"", Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video for the video for ""Ojos Así"".[35] She won two Grammy Awards.","Upon the success of Dónde Están los Ladrones? and MTV Unplugged, Shakira began working on an English crossover album.[36] She worked for over a year on new material for the album. ""Whenever, Wherever"", called ""Suerte"" in Spanish-speaking countries, was released as the first and lead single from her first English album and fifth studio album throughout the period between August 2001 and February 2002. The song took heavy influence from Andean music, including the charango and panpipes in its instrumentation. It became an international success by reaching number one in most countries. It was also her first success in the U.S., by reaching number six on the Hot 100. In 2003, Shakira wrote a song called ""Come Down Love"" with Tim Mitchell for the Hollywood movie The Italian Job starring South African actress Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg, but the song was not included on the soundtrack of the movie.[citation needed]","Shakira's fifth studio album and first English language album, titled Laundry Service in English-speaking countries and Servicio De Lavanderia in Latin America and Spain, was released on 13 November 2001. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling over 200,000 records in its first week. The album was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA in June 2004 as well.[37] It helped to establish Shakira's musical presence in the mainstream North American market. Seven singles were taken from the album such as ""Whenever, Wherever""/""Suerte"", ""Underneath Your Clothes"", ""Objection (Tango)""/""Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)"", ""The One"", ""Te Dejo Madrid"", ""Que Me Quedes Tú"", and ""Poem to a Horse"".","Because the album was created for the English-language market, the rock and Spanish dance-influenced album gained mild critical success, with some critics claiming that her English skills were too weak for her to write songs for it; Rolling Stone, for one, stated that ""she sounds downright silly"" or ""Shakira's magic is lost in translation"".[volume & issue needed] Shakira was also criticized by some of her Latin fans for seemingly abandoning her folk and rock roots in favor of contemporary American pop music. Despite this fact, the album became the best selling album of 2002, selling more than 20 million copies worldwide.[22][38][39][40] and became the most successful album of her career to date. Around this time, Shakira also released four songs for Pepsi for her promotion in the English markets: ""Ask for More"", ""Pide Más"", ""Knock on My Door"", and ""Pídeme el Sol"".","In 2002, at Aerosmith's MTV Icon in April 2002, Shakira performed ""Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"".

He also commented on their work together on the song ""Neon Lights"" from Lovato's fourth studio album, saying, ""She, in pop music, has one of the biggest ranges, possibly the highest full voice singer I've ever worked with.""[197] Tamsyn Wilce from Alter The Press commented on her vocals on Demi, stating ""it shows just how strong her vocal cords are and the variation of styles that she can completely work to make her own.""[198] In a review for the 'Neon Lights Tour,' Mike Wass from Idolator commented ""you don't need shiny distractions when you can belt out songs like Demi and connect with the crowd on such an emotional level.""[199] In a review for the 'Demi World Tour,' Marielle Wakim from Los Angeles Magazine commented on Lovato's vocals, stating ""For those who haven’t bothered to follow Lovato's career, let's get something out of the way: the girl can sing. Get over your fear of being judged by your Facebook friends and Spotify her discography, because you’re going to have the last laugh five years down the road (probably sooner) when she wins a Grammy. At 22 years old, her vocal range is astounding."" She went on to further describe her vocals as ""spectacular.""[200]","On her 18th birthday, Lovato bought a Mediterranean-style house in Los Angeles, California; however, she decided to live in a ""sober house"" in Los Angeles after leaving rehab in January 2011.[201]","In 2010, Lovato began dating actor Wilmer Valderrama.[202][203] They announced the end of their relationship on social media on June 3, 2016.[204]","Lovato had no interest in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother.[205] She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, ""He was mean, but he wanted to be a good person.

Jennifer_Lopez,"Jennifer Lynn Lopez[3][4] (born July 24, 1969), also known as JLo, is an American singer, actress, dancer, fashion designer, author, and producer. Lopez gained her first high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color in 1991, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. She received her first leading role in the Selena biopic of the same name in 1997, a portrayal that earned her a Golden Globe nomination. For her role in Out of Sight the following year, Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She ventured into the music industry in 1999 with her debut studio album On the 6, preceded by the number-one single ""If You Had My Love"".","With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her film The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. Following her second divorce, Lopez had a high-profile relationship with Ben Affleck, which strongly influenced her third studio album, This Is Me... Then (2002), while also overshadowing the release of Gigli (2003), a critical and commercial failure. She subsequently married longtime friend Marc Anthony, and rebounded with the box office successes Shall We Dance? (2004) and Monster-in-Law (2005). Her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States.[5] Lopez gave birth to twins in 2008, and after a relatively unsuccessful period, returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on American Idol and most commercially successful single to date, ""On the Floor"", which is one of the best-selling singles of all time. In 2016, she began starring as Harlee Santos in the crime drama series Shades of Blue.","With a cumulative film gross of over US$2.89 billion[6] and global record sales exceeding 80 million,[7][8][9] she is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, as well as its highest paid Latin entertainer.[10] Time listed her as one of the 25 most influential Hispanic Americans,[11] and in 2012, Forbes ranked her as the most powerful celebrity in the world, as well as the 38th most powerful woman in the world.[12] For her contributions to the arts, Lopez has received a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Billboard Icon Award, among other honors. Beyond entertainment, she enjoys a successful business career consisting of various clothing lines, accessories, fragrances, a production company, and a charitable foundation, among other ventures.",,,"Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969, in the Castle Hill neighborhood of The Bronx, New York,[13] to Puerto Rican parents Guadalupe Rodríguez and David Lopez. She has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, Lynda, a journalist.[14] David worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while Guadalupe was a homemaker. When Lopez was born, the family was living in a small apartment. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.[15] At the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old. Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home—singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay ""out of trouble"".[16] Lopez spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at Preston High School.[17] In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level, and was a member of the school's softball team.[18] She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships.[16]","While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman.[19] Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a ""famous movie star"". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in Baruch College, only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents about her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a ""really stupid"" idea and that ""no Latinos did that"". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma!. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a Golden Musicals of Broadway, which toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. She later got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer, and choreographer.[15]","Lopez was selected as a backup dancer for the New Kids on the Block in 1991 and performed with them during their performance of ""Games"" at the 18th Annual American Music Awards.[20] Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television program In Living Color. She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unavailable to continue with the show. Out of 2,000 applicants, Lopez made it to the finals. She was the runner-up but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved with Cruz to Los Angeles to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993, when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist Janet Jackson.[21] Lopez was set to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but backed out as she wanted to do her ""own thing"".[22]","Lopez received her first professional acting gig in the direct-to-video drama film Lost in the Wild (1993), co-starring with Lindsay Wagner and Robert Loggia.[23] Later in 1993, Lopez signed a deal with CBS to co-star in the television series Second Chances. Lopez received her first major big-screen role in Gregory Nava's 1995 drama My Family portraying Young Maria.[24] Although her role was uncredited, Lopez received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for her performance.[24] In November 1995, Lopez starred in Money Train alongside Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson as New York City transit cops. In August 1996, Lopez had a supporting role in the comedy Jack.[25]","In February 1997, Lopez starred alongside Jack Nicholson and Stephen Dorff in the neo-noir thriller Blood and Wine.[26] Lopez starred as the title role of the Selena biopic of the same name in March.[27] Despite having previously worked with the film's director on My Family, Lopez was subjected to an intense auditioning process before she was cast in the film.[28] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that even in the ""forgettable films"" Money Train, and Jack, Lopez's ""presence and ability made her seem just one role away from stardom"" and with Selena she's ""seized the opportunity and turned in an incandescent presentation that is especially strong during the film's numerous musical numbers"". He concluded by calling the film not just a celebration of Selena's life, but also of the actress who portrayed her.[29] After filming Selena, Lopez was ""really feeling [her] Latin roots"" and cut a demo in Spanish.[30] Lopez's manager then sent the song, titled ""Vivir Sin Ti"" (Living without You), to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead.[31]","In April, Lopez starred in the horror film Anaconda alongside Ice Cube and Jon Voight.[32] Lopez starred alongside Sean Penn and Billy Bob Thornton in the crime film U Turn in October. The film, which is based on the novel Stray Dogs by John Ridley, received somewhat positive reviews from critics.[33] In June, Lopez starred opposite George Clooney in Out of Sight, Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name (1996).[34] Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal, Lopez won rave reviews for her performance and became the first Latina actress to earn over $1 million for a role.[35] Lopez provided the voice of Azteca in the computer-animated film Antz in October.[36]","Lopez's debut single, ""If You Had My Love"", was released in May 1999, as she began to ready her first album.[37][38] Lopez became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with a debut single since Britney Spears did so with her single ""...Baby One More Time"" four months prior.[39] During production of her debut album, On the 6, Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the basis of her looks and an already established name in the entertainment industry, and she wanted to prove she had musical talent.[40] Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: ""If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.""[41] ""Waiting for Tonight"", the third single from On the 6, is widely considered to be Lopez's best song.[42] Lopez's musical success came as a surprise to critics; its launch made the ""popular actor even more popular"". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by ""this woman who seemed to have so many different talents"".[41] By the end of 1999, Lopez successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.[43] She joined a select few in achieving this feat, becoming the first since Vanessa Williams (1992) and Martika (1989).[39]","On February 23, 2000, Lopez, accompanied by then boyfriend Sean Combs, wore a plunging exotic green Versace silk chiffon dress on the red carpet of the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards. The dress ""had a low-cut neck that extended several inches below her navel, where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again,"" exposing her midriff and then as cut along the front of the legs like a bath robe.[44] The dress generated controversy and media attention, with images of Lopez in the dress being downloaded from the Grammy website over half a million times 24 hours after the event.[45] Lopez was surprised by the enormous media coverage, declaring that she had no idea ""it was going to become such a big deal"".[46] This dress was the main reason that the chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt said they invented a way to search for images, creating Google Images.[47] Lopez returned to the big-screen in August, starring in the psychological thriller The Cell opposite Vincent D'Onofrio.[48]","During the process of recording her second album, Lopez decided to tweak her image as she began to develop into a sex symbol. She changed her stage name to J.Lo, a nickname she was given by her fans.[49] She subsequently named the album J.Lo. Released on January 23, 2001, it was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200.[50] During the same week, her romantic comedy film The Wedding Planner in which she starred opposite Matthew McConaughey opened atop the box office. This made her the first woman to have a number one film and album simultaneously in the United States.[11] The album was preceded by the release of its lead single, ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"", which reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. It was followed by the single ""Play"".[51] In April 2001, Lopez launched J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez, her own clothing and accessory company. Lopez felt that ""the voluptuous woman [was] almost ignored"" in the fashion industry, and therefore her company specialized in clothing women of all shapes.[49] The following month, she starred in the romantic drama film Angel Eyes, which performed disappointingly at the box office and generated mixed reviews.[52] After several months, J.Lo was declining on the charts; this prompted Mottola to recruit rapper Ja Rule to create an urban-oriented remix of the song ""I'm Real"". This led to the release of ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"", which quickly reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Its success resulted in J.Lo being reissued to include the single, which was number one in the United States during the week of the September 11 attacks.[51] J.Lo became the best-selling album of Lopez's career, having sold 3.8 million copies in the US and moved over 12 million units worldwide.[53][54]","Having redefined Lopez's sound with ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"", Epic decided to release further remixes in order to ""keep the momentum going"".[55] A remix album entitled J to tha L–O! The Remixes was subsequently released on February 5, 2002. It debuted at the summit of the Billboard 200, making it the first remix album to do so. Its lead single, ""Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)"", featuring Ja Rule and Caddillac Tah, reached number one in the US.[56] J to tha L–O! The Remixes became one of the best-selling remix albums of all time, selling 1.5 million copies in the US.[57] It produced two more singles: ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" and ""Alive"", a ballad co-written by her husband at the time, Cris Judd. In April 2002, Lopez opened her restaurant, Madrè's.[49] The following month, she starred in the thriller film Enough, which was described by the Boston Herald as a ""kick-but, female empowerment"" film.[58] While filming Enough, which required an overworked Lopez to practice Krav Maga, she suffered a nervous breakdown. She recalled feeling ""sick and weird"", refusing therapeutic help or medication. She confessed, ""I was like – I don't want to move, I don't want to talk, I don't want to do anything.""[59] In September, she released her first fragrance, Glow by JLo. It performed strongly despite predictions that it would fail, and became the top-selling fragrance in the US.[60]","Lopez's third studio album, This Is Me... Then, was released on November 25, 2002. It was dedicated to actor Ben Affleck, her fiancé at the time. The album's lead single ""Jenny from the Block"", was later described by Sam Lansky of MTV News as her most iconic single.[61] In the song, Lopez ""intones her modest childhood roots"".[62] The album itself performed strongly, selling 2.6 million copies in the US.[57] Its second single, ""All I Have"", peaked at number one in the US. That December, Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes in the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan, which became the highest-grossing film of her career.[63]","In August 2003, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli. The film was a box office bomb, and is considered one of the worst films of all time. The film's poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release, as well as the media attention surrounding Lopez and Affleck's engagement which largely overshadowed the film.[63][64] Lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career, saying ""[It] was very tough"", ""the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment.""[65] In October of that year, she released her next fragrance, Still Jennifer Lopez. Lopez also launched her next fashion label, Sweetface. It was described by Andy Hilfiger as a ""more intellectual, more inspirational collection than J-Lo by Jennifer Lopez. Less sporty, more suede.""[66] Lopez's clothing lines and two fragrances generated over $300 million in revenue throughout 2004, which made her the 19th richest person under 40.[11]","In March 2004, Lopez had a minor role in the film Jersey Girl, alongside Affleck. Her character, Gertrude Steiney, dies during childbirth within the first 15 minutes of the film. From the intense media scrutiny following the couple's break-up, it was noted that ""they may need to put Lopez in a coffin on the poster if they want anyone to come"".[67] In October, Lopez co-starred alongside Richard Gere in the drama Shall We Dance?, a re-make of the 1996 Japanese film of the same title. The film was successful at the box office, and was considered a rebound for Lopez following Gigli.[63]","After placing her career on hiatus, Lopez released her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in February 2005. According to Lopez, Rebirth ""came about because I was on such a roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, and I did a bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [when] I came back, this was the first project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for me, like I was, in a way, reborn.""[68] Tracy Hopkins of NBC's Today Music noted that after ""fawning"" over Affleck on This Is Me... Then"", Lopez ""wisely keeps her love life out of the spotlight"" on Rebirth and only references her relationship with Anthony on a few tracks.[69] The album produced the single ""Get Right"", which peaked at number one in the United Kingdom.[70] In May, she starred alongside Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law, for which she received a salary of $15 million.[71] The film's marketing played up Lopez's ""Gigli-and-tabloid tarnished image"", and it became a box office success.[63][72] In August, Lopez starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in An Unfinished Life, a drama film based on the novel of the same name.","In April 2006, Lopez reappeared on the Billboard Hot 100 as a featured artist on ""Control Myself"", the lead single from LL Cool J's twelfth studio album Todd Smith. The song peaked at number four on the chart following its release as a music download, making it the pair's second collaboration to reach the top five.[73] Bordertown, a film based on the Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, made its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2006. Lopez, who also acts as the film's producer, stars as Lauren Adrian, an American news reporter for the Chicago Sentinel who wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war.[74] Bordertown received a direct-to-video release.[63] DanceLife, a reality series following the lives of seven dancers trying to break into the world of professional dance, aired on MTV from January 15 to March 5, 2007. Lopez produced, created and was featured in the show.[75] According to the album's co-producer Estéfano, Lopez's fifth studio album Como Ama una Mujer would ""prove critics wrong"" with its ""big songs that require a voice""; referring to the criticism of Lopez having a ""limited"" vocal tone.[76][77] The album's lead single ""Qué Hiciste"" reached number one on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart. Lopez performed the song on the sixth season of American Idol on April 11, 2007, becoming the first person to perform a Spanish song on the series.[70] The album received the highest first-week sales in the United States for a Spanish album and the highest digital sales.[78]","In September 2007, Lopez starred in the biographical film El Cantante, which is based on the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe. In the film, Lavoe is portrayed by then-husband Marc Anthony while Lopez plays Lavoe's wife Puchi.[79] Lopez revealed that she felt her performance in the film El Cantante, should have earned her an Oscar.[80] ""I feel like I had that [Oscar worthy role] in 'El Cantante,' but I don't think the academy members saw it"".[80] El Cantante did not perform well at the box office, earning just $7.6 million.[63] Lopez and Anthony also launched their co-headlining North American concert tour on September 28.[81] Lopez's sixth studio album Brave, released in October, was her lowest-charting album worldwide.[82] The album produced two singles, ""Do It Well"" and ""Hold It Don't Drop It"". The first peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the latter failed to make any significant impact on the charts. A five-part miniseries, Jennifer Lopez Presents: Como Ama una Mujer, based on the lyrics of Como Ama una Mujer aired on Univision from October 30 to November 27, 2007. She placed her career on hiatus after giving birth to twins in February 2008.[83] In late 2009, Lopez released two songs for her seventh studio album, Love? (""Louboutins"" and ""Fresh Out of the Oven""); however, the songs failed to make an appearance on the Billboard charts which led to her departure from Epic Records.[84]","Lopez parted ways with Epic Records in February 2010, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release her seventh studio album Love? under a new label.[85] Her departure from the label temporarily halted production on the album, which commenced in 2009.

The song topped the charts across the globe, becoming one of the most successful singles of the year.[96] The song also became her highest charting single commercially as a lead artist, as well as her most successful airplay hit on contemporary hit radio, since ""Jenny from the Block"".[97] Love?, which was released in May, was a moderate commercial success, and was viewed as a humble comeback from Lopez, as many had considered her recording career over.[82] Lopez launched her next fragrance Love and Light in July, exclusively on HSN. 51,000 bottles of the fragrance were sold at its premiere, becoming Lopez's most successful fragrance launch to date, making over $2.9 million.[98] In September, Lopez launched the Jennifer Lopez Collection, a clothing and accessories line for Kohl's with Tommy Hilfiger.[99] In addition to the clothing line, she also launched the Jennifer Lopez Home Collection, featuring bedding, towels and luggage.[100] Later that same month Fiat, an Italian automobile manufacturer, enlisted Lopez to promote their products, including the 2012 Fiat 500 Cabrio.

In addition, she founded the mobile phone retail brand Viva Móvil, which is catered specifically for Latinos.[121] She lobbied for more Hispanic diversity on television,[122] hoping to empower the Latin community in these media ventures, stating: ""There's a big revolution going on, it's like a media and cultural revolution of Latinos here in the United States.

We're realizing that we matter here.""[123] Inspired by her gay aunt who had recently died, Lopez signed on as executive producer of the television series The Fosters, which is about a same-sex couple raising a family.[124] The show premiered on ABC Family on June 3, 2013, and has since been a ratings success for the network.[125] Later that June, Lopez performed at the birthday of Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov.[126] Doing so, she garnered widespread backlash for performing for the leader of a ""repressive, authoritarian regime"".[127] Her publicist released an apology.[126] Lopez returned as judge on American Idol for its thirteenth season for a reported salary of $17.5 million.[128] She was ranked as the fifth highest-paid woman in music for 2013, having earned $45 million.[108]","After the conclusion of her Dance Again World Tour, Lopez began recording her eighth studio album, A.K.A., inspired by her travels.[129] It was released in June 2014 through Capitol Records, experiencing lackluster sales.[130] The album produced three singles: ""I Luh Ya Papi"", which features French Montana, ""First Love"", and ""Booty"", featuring Pitbull or rapper Iggy Azalea. ""Booty"" debuted inside the top twenty in the United States, making it her second-highest debut on the Billboard Hot 100 after ""On the Floor"".[131] In April, the official song for the 2014 FIFA World Cup performed by Pitbull, Lopez and Brazilian recording artist Claudia Leitte, ""We Are One (Ole Ola)"", was released.

It will air on NBC.[167]","Lopez's personal life has attracted widespread media attention.[168] From February 22, 1997, to January 1998, she was married to Cuban waiter Ojani Noa.[169] Since their brief marriage, Lopez has endured many legal troubles regarding her relationship with Noa. In April 2006, she sued to prevent him from publishing a book about their marriage, contending that it violated their confidentiality agreement.[170] The following year, a court-appointed arbitrator issued a permanent injunction forbidding Noa from ""criticizing, denigrating, casting in a negative light or otherwise disparaging"" Lopez. She was awarded $545,000 in compensatory damages and Noa was ordered to hand over all copies of materials related to the book to Lopez or her attorney.[171] A lawsuit regarding a compromising private honeymoon video in Noa's possession is presently running.[172]","While working on her first album, On the 6, Lopez began dating record producer and rapper Sean Combs. On December 27, 1999, the couple were arrested along with two others in connection with a shooting outside the Times Square Club in New York. They were charged with criminal possession of a weapon as well as stolen property. Lopez was soon exonerated, having had nothing to do with the crime.[173] However, Combs was charged and indicted by a Manhattan grand jury.[174] After leaving Combs, Lopez developed a relationship with former back-up dancer Cris Judd, to whom she was married from September 29, 2001, to June 2002.[175] Following her second divorce due to irreconcilable differences, she commenced a high-profile relationship with actor and director Ben Affleck, to whom she became engaged in November 2002.[176][177] The media began to refer to them as ""Bennifer"", and they became a prominent supercouple in the media and popular culture. Bennifer became a popular term, which was eventually entered into urban dictionaries and neologism dictionaries as notable,[178] as the name blend started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of their first names.[179] The couple postponed their nuptials indefinitely a day prior to the planned ceremony in September 2003, citing the media's interference with the event as the reason.[180]","Following her break-up with Affleck in January 2004, Lopez began dating longtime friend Marc Anthony (real name: Marco Antonio Muñiz). The couple wed that June,[181][182] and lived in Brookville, New York.[183] Two men attempted to ransom a private wedding video that was stolen from the couple for one million dollars; however, they were arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of conspiracy, attempted grand larceny and possession of stolen property.[184] On November 7, 2007, during the final night of their co-headlining tour, Lopez and Anthony officially confirmed that they were expecting their first child.[185] The announcement ended months of speculation over the pregnancy.[186] Her father confirmed that the couple were expecting twins, revealing that it runs in the family: ""My sister also had twins, so it's a hereditary thing.""[187] Lopez, who is a Roman Catholic, has stated that her faith discouraged her from pursuing in vitro fertilization treatment while trying to get pregnant.[188]","Lopez gave birth to a son, Maximilian David, and a daughter, Emme Maribel, in Long Island, New York, on February 22, 2008.[189][190] The twins were introduced in the March 11, 2008, issue of People, for which the magazine paid a reported $6 million; the photographs of the twins became the most expensive celebrity picture ever taken at the time.[191] Three years later in July 2011, the couple announced their split, with Anthony filing for divorce in April 2012.[192] Their divorce was finalized on June 16, 2014, with Lopez retaining primary physical custody of the two children.[193] On December 31, 2014, she legally changed her name back to Jennifer Lopez, dropping Anthony's last name (Muñiz).[194]","Lopez had an on-off relationship with her former backup dancer Casper Smart from October 2011 to August 2016.[195][196] In February 2017, she began dating former New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez.[197][198]","Lopez endorsed President Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign, speaking in television advertisements and attending a fundraising event for Obama in Paris.[199][200] She endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, headlining a free concert in Florida in support of her that October; she urged Latinos in particular to vote for Clinton.[200][201]","Following the September 11 attacks, Lopez was heavily involved in charitable activities. Joining various other artists, she was featured on charitable singles such as ""What's Going On"" and ""El Ultimo Adios (The Last Goodbye)"", which benefited people affected by the tragedy.[202][203] One dollar from each ticket sold at Lopez and Anthony's co-headlining North American concert tour, which grossed an estimated $10 million, was donated to Run for Something Better—a charitable organization supporting physical fitness programs for children.[81][204] In February 2007, Lopez was honored with the Artists for Amnesty prize by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, for her work in the film Bordertown, which shed light on the hundreds of female homicides in Ciudad Juárez. Lopez described it as ""one of the world's most shocking and disturbing, underreported crimes against humanity.""[205][206]","In 2009, Lopez launched the Lopez Family Foundation (originally known as the Maribel Foundation) alongside her sister, Lynda. The nonprofit organization seeks to increase the availability of healthcare for underprivileged women and children, offering a telemedicine program supported by a partnership with the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The foundation has led to the expansion of medical facilities in Panama and Puerto Rico, and created the Center for a Healthy Childhood at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.[207][208]","In December 2012, Lopez held a charity drive that would affect her three favorite charities: the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club, the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles as well as the American Red Cross, mainly benefiting victims of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of her home town, New York City.[209] In May 2015, she became the first national celebrity spokesperson for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and the BC Children's Hospital Foundation (BCCHF), appearing in a campaign entitled ""Put Your Money Where the Miracles Are"".[210] That September, Lopez was announced as the first Global Advocate for Girls and Women at the United Nations Foundation.[211] This role sees her mobilizing action to address challenges faced by girls and women around the world, including maternal health care programs, education and violence against women.[212]","Lopez is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has raised millions of dollars for HIV/AIDS research.[213] In June 2013, amfAR presented Lopez with its humanitarian award for her philanthropic work.[213] That September, she was awarded the Ally for Equality award presented by the Human Rights Campaign, for her support of the LGBT community.[214] The following year, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award.[215] In July 2016, Lopez released a single entitled ""Love Make the World Go Round"", a collaboration with Lin-Manuel Miranda, which benefits victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.[216] She was also featured on the song ""Hands"" along with numerous other artists, also benefiting those affected by the Orlando shooting.[217] Among numerous other artists, Lopez signed an open letter from Billboard magazine to the United States Congress in 2016, which demanded action on gun control.[218]","According to author Ed Morales in The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond (2003), Lopez's music explores the ""romantic innocence"" of Latin music, while strongly identifying with hip hop.[221] Growing up, she was influenced by Latin styles ranging from salsa to bachata, but it was the 1979 hip hop song ""Rapper's Delight"" by The Sugarhill Gang that she said changed her life.[222] Her debut album On the 6 fuses the influence of Latin music with R&B and hip hop, which Lopez described as Latin soul. To the contrary, Morales described it as ""state-of-the-art dance pop"".[223] Dee Lockett, writing for the Chicago Tribune, stated that songs such as ""Waiting for Tonight"" made Lopez ""arguably the leading artist in the dance-pop movement at the time"".[224] While primarily sung in English, she speaks in Spanish and asserts her Latin heritage throughout the album, which is apparent in the song ""Let's Get Loud"".[225][226][227] She has also recorded bilingual songs, including the Latin pop song ""Cariño"", for her second album J.Lo.[228] A departure from her previous albums, This Is Me... Then blends 1970s soul with ""streetwise"" hip hop.[229] ""Get Right"", from Rebirth, is built around a sample of ""Soul Power 74"" by Maceo and the Macks, and is characterized by a repetitive saxophone riff. The New York Times called it ""one of the year's most unusual R&B songs"" which sounded ""like nothing else on the radio"".[230]","Described as autobiographical,[231] much of Lopez's music has centered around the ""ups and downs"" of love.[232] The lyrical content of This Is Me... Then is largely focused on her relationship with Ben Affleck, with the song ""Dear Ben"" being described as the album's ""glowing centerpiece"".[233] Her first full length Spanish-language album, Como Ama una Mujer features introspective lyrics about romance, heartache and self-loathing.[234] When explaining her seventh studio album Love?, Lopez stated: ""There's still so much to learn and that's why the question mark.""[232] Other recurrent themes in Lopez's music have included her upbringing in the Bronx[223][235] and women's empowerment.[236]","Lopez has been influenced by artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Barbra Streisand.[237][238] She credited Rita Moreno's performance in the 1961 musical film West Side Story as a major inspiration.[223] Critics have considered Lopez's voice to be limited,[239][240] and obscured by the production of her music, while remaining ""radio-friendly"".[241] Rolling Stone observed: ""Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R&B murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn't need to belt because she knows you're already paying attention [...] She makes a little va-va and a whole lot of voom go a long way.""[242] Meanwhile, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called her voice ""slight"" and wrote: ""Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style"".[243] Entertainment Weekly criticized her vocal performance for lacking the trademark ""husky-voiced voluptuousness"" she has in her films.[244] The Baltimore Sun regards Lopez as having a ""breathy"" stylistic range, but lacking personality.[245]","Considered one of dance's ""greatest success stories"",[163] Lopez felt an emotional connection to dance since her youth, when she specialized in ballet, jazz and flamenco.[246][247] Her career commenced on the variety television sketch comedy series In Living Color, where she was a part of an ethnically diverse dance group known as The Fly Girls.[248] Janet Jackson, whom she briefly served as a backup dancer for, has been credited by Lopez as an inspiration for her own dance and videos.[249] Since beginning her own recording career, Lopez has become known for her body-emphasizing music videos, which often include dance routines.[250] Some of them have been the subject of controversy, including ""Jenny from the Block"", ""Dance Again"" and ""Booty"".[251][252] Her provocatively choreographed music video for ""If You Had My Love"" allowed Lopez to become a dominant figure on MTV networks worldwide,[253] while the accompanying video for ""Waiting for Tonight"" established her as a ""dance princess"" according to MTV.[254]","On stage, Lopez is recognized for her showmanship and sex appeal,[255] and often includes costumes such as bodysuits as part of her performance.[256][257][258] Author Priscilla Peña Ovalle stated in Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex and Stardom (2011) that Lopez was one of the Latin stars who ""used dance to gain agency as working performers with mainstream careers, yet many of their roles paradoxically racialized and sexualized their bodies"".[259] Troy Patterson of Entertainment Weekly also observed that she used her body for emphasis on stage, ""She turned herself out as the fly girl hyperversion of postfeminist power, flaunting her control by toying with the threat of excess. In consequence, her star went supernova.""[260] Her signature movements include ""clock-wise pivoting with salsa hip circles and sequential torso undulations"".[261] While being noted to lip sync in the early stages of career, Lopez's Dance Again World Tour was praised for showcasing live vocals and choreography synchronously.[262][263][264] In a review of her Las Vegas residency All I Have, Los Angeles Times writer Nolan Feeney called her ""Queen of the Strip"" and remarked that her dancing is ""undoubtedly the centerpiece of the show"".[255]","Lopez's provocative stage performances have also drawn scrutiny at times. In May 2013, her performance on the finale of the television series Britain's Got Talent was deemed inappropriate for family-friendly television, and drew viewer complaints to Ofcom.[265][266] Following her controversial performance at the musical festival Mawazine in 2015, Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane called it ""indecent"" and ""disgraceful"", while an education group claimed that she ""disturbed public order and tarnished women's honor and respect"".[267]","Speaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: ""Despite a carefully cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles ""I'm Real"" and ""Jenny From the Block"". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick either as a primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she's not asking you to come hither.""[220] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: ""Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere."" Holloway noted her image to be ""a dash of ghetto fabulousness"" and ""middle-class respectability"" for mass appeal.[268] Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: ""Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth madre.""[269] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture.[270] Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a ""showbiz phenomenon"".[271]","Lopez has developed an image as a sex symbol and ""one of the most desirable women on the planet"".[272] She is widely celebrated for her curvaceous figure,[273] which was the inspiration for Sir Mix-a-Lot's 1992 hit ""Baby Got Back"".[274] She has been credited with influencing a change in mainstream female body image.[275] In Latin Sensations (2001), Herón Marquez wrote: ""Because she wasn't rail thin, Lopez had broken the mold and allowed millions of women to feel good about their bodies. Suddenly, it was okay for women to have hips, curves, and a big backside.""[41] Vanity Fair described her buttocks as ""in and of themselves, a cultural icon"".[276] Details magazine named Lopez the ""Sexiest Woman of the Year"" in 1998,[277] and she led FHM's ""100 Sexiest Women"" list twice.[278] In 2011, she was named ""The Most Beautiful Woman"" by People.[279] The following year, VH1 ranked her the fourth on their list of ""100 Sexiest Artists"",[280] while Vibe magazine named her the most ""lustable"" celebrity of the past twenty years.[281] In 2014, Lopez stated, ""There's this funny notion in America that you can't be a mom and be sexy (...) It's the craziest thing I've ever heard... The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die.""[135]","Lopez is a tabloid fixture[282][283] and has admitted to having a ""less-than-perfect"" public image.[284] The media often draw comparisons between Lopez and actress Elizabeth Taylor, due to her numerous failed relationships.[285][286] In fact, Lopez has been dubbed a ""modern-day Liz Taylor"" by the media.[287] Lynn Hirschberg of W compared her glamorous public persona to that of Taylor.[288] Her style is described by Billboard's Lauren Savage as scantily clad.[289] Lopez has been criticized by the animal rights organization PETA for inclusion of fur in her fashion lines and outfits.[290] She has received a bad reputation as being a demanding ""diva"",[291] but she constantly refutes this.[292] In 2003, The Observer remarked that Lopez was ""the woman immortalised in a million headlines as 'Hollywood's most demanding diva' ... Lopez must wonder what heinous crime she has committed to become the most vilified woman in modern popular culture.""[293]","Lopez is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, credited with breaking racial barriers in the entertainment industry.[18][294] In 1999, The Record newspaper observed that she was responsible for the introduction of a Latina presence in the film industry, which was a ""whites-only preserve"" for much of its history.[295] Described as a ""multidimensional artist who had turned into a financial powerhouse"",[10] Lopez became the highest-paid actress of Hispanic descent in history.[296] Miriam Jiménez Román stated in The Afro-Latin Reader: History and Culture in the United States (2009) that ""[she] was able to traverse the difficult racial boundaries"".[297] In 2012, business magazine Forbes suggested that Lopez ""may be the most powerful entertainer on the planet"",[298] and named her ""the world's most powerful Latino celebrity"".[299]","Upon launching her music career in the late 1990s, Lopez contributed to the ""Latin explosion"" occurring in entertainment at the time,[300] with the Daily Herald describing her as ""crossover royalty"".[301] She was featured on the cover of the first issue of Latina magazine in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza stating that there is ""no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer"".[302] Around this time, the emphasis on Lopez's curvaceous figure grew; scholar Sean Redmond wrote that this was a sign of her role and social power in the cultural changes occurring in the United States.[303] In August 2005, Time listed Lopez as one of the most influential Hispanics in America, remarking: ""Why? Because over a decade ago, she was an anonymous background dancer on the second-rated sketch-comedy show. Today she's known by two syllables.""[11] In February 2007, People en Español named her the most influential Hispanic entertainer.[294] In 2014, scientists named a species of aquatic mite found in Puerto Rico, Litarachna lopezae, after Lopez.[304][305]","Lopez is considered a global icon, and is often described as a triple threat performer.[8][306][307] VH1 ranked her at number 15 on a list of ""200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons"",[308] number 16 on ""100 Greatest Women In Music"",[309] and number 21 on ""50 Greatest Women of the Video Era"".[310] Lopez has been cited as an influence or inspiration by a range of entertainers, including Demi Lovato,[311] Jessica Alba,[312] Adrienne Bailon,[313] Kat DeLuna,[314] Mike Doughty,[315] Becky G,[316] Selena Gomez,[317] Kelly Key,[318] Q'orianka Kilcher,[319] Pitbull,[320] Francia Raisa,[313] Naya Rivera,[321] Stooshe,[322] Fifth Harmony,[323] Ryan Guzman[324] and Kerry Washington.[325]","Famed for her distinct style and fashion sense, Us Weekly named Lopez ""Style Icon"" of the 2000s decade.[326] The Green Versace ""Jungle Dress"" that she wore at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000 was voted the fifth most iconic red carpet dress of all time in a poll run by The Daily Telegraph.[327] The images of Lopez wearing the dress became the most popular search query of all time at that point, and subsequently led to the creation of Google's image search.[328] Her style has influenced a range of celebrities, including Kelly Rowland, Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Love Hewitt.[329][330][331] Her record-breaking fragrance line has become the most successful celebrity line in the world, with sales exceeding $2 billion.[332] Following the success of Lopez's appointment as a judge on American Idol in 2010, a trend of networks hiring ""big names"" for judging panels on reality shows ensued.

Instagram,"Instagram is a mobile, desktop, and internet-based photo-sharing application and service that allows users to share pictures and videos either publicly or privately. It was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and launched in October 2010 as a free mobile app exclusively for the iOS operating system. A version for Android devices was released two years later, in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited website interface in November 2012, and apps for Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 in April 2016 and October 2016 respectively.","Instagram lets registered users upload photos or videos to the service. Users can apply various digital filters to their images, and add locations through geotags. They can add hashtags to their posts, linking the photos up to other content on Instagram featuring the same subject or overall topic. Users can connect their Instagram account to other social media profiles, enabling them to share photos to those profiles as well. Originally, a distinctive feature of Instagram was its confining of photos to a square; this was changed in August 2015, when an update started allowing users to upload media at full size. In June 2012, an ""Explore"" tab was introduced in the mobile apps, showing users a variety of media, including (but not limited to) popular photos and photos taken at nearby locations, trending tags and places, channels for recommended videos, and curated content. Support for videos was originally launched in June 2013, and had a 15-second maximum duration and limited quality, with Instagram later adding support for widescreen and longer videos. Private messaging, called Instagram Direct, was launched with basic photo-sharing functionality in December 2013, and has gradually received major updates incorporating more features, including easier private sharing from the news feed, threaded conversations, sharing locations and hashtag pages, increased support for text and emoji, and the ability to make photos ""disappear"" after being viewed by the recipient. In August 2016, Instagram introduced a ""Stories"" feature, letting users add photos to a story, with the content disappearing after 24 hours. Instagram added live-video functionality to Stories in November 2016, and augmented reality stickers in April 2017.","After its launch in 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and ultimately 700 million as of April 2017. The service was acquired by Facebook in April 2012 for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.

As Krieger reasoned, Burbn became too similar to Foursquare, and both realized that it had gone too far. Burbn was then pivoted to become more focused on photo-sharing.[7][8] The word Instagram is a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.[8]","On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[9] Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[10] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[10] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[10][11]","On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store.[12][13]","In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[14] The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million.[15]","On April 3, 2012, Instagram was released for Android phones,[16][17] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[18]","In March 2012, The Wall Street Journal reported that Instagram was raising a new round of financing that would value the company at $500 million,[19] details that were confirmed the following month, when Instagram raised $50 million from venture capitalists with a $500 million valuation.[20] The same month, Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock,[21][22][23] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[24][25][26] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[27] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[28] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook was officially closed.[29]","The deal, which was made just prior to Facebook's scheduled IPO, cost about a quarter of Facebook's cash-on-hand, according to figures documented at the end of 2011.[26] The deal was for a company characterized as having ""lots of buzz but no business model"", and the price was contrasted with the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[26] Mark Zuckerberg noted that Facebook was ""committed to building and growing Instagram independently"", in contrast to its past practices.[26] According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400 million based on his ownership stake in the business.[30] The exact purchase price was $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[31]","In November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see users' feeds from their web browsers.

Oprah_Winfrey,"Orpah Gail Winfrey (born January 29, 1954), better known as Oprah Winfrey, is an American media proprietor, talk show host, actress, producer, and philanthropist.[1] She is best known for her talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show, which was the highest-rated television program of its kind in history and was nationally syndicated from 1986 to 2011 in Chicago, Illinois.[5] Dubbed the ""Queen of All Media"",[6] she has been ranked the richest African-American,[7] the greatest black philanthropist in American history,[8][9] and is currently North America's first and only multi-billionaire black person.[10] Several assessments rank her as the most influential woman in the world.[11][12] In 2013, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[13] and honorary doctorate degrees from Duke and Harvard.[14][15]","Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a teenage single mother and later raised in an inner-city Milwaukee neighborhood. She has stated that she was molested during her childhood and early teens and became pregnant at 14; her son died in infancy.[16] Sent to live with the man she calls her father, a barber in Tennessee, Winfrey landed a job in radio while still in high school and began co-anchoring the local evening news at the age of 19. Her emotional ad-lib delivery eventually got her transferred to the daytime talk show arena, and after boosting a third-rated local Chicago talk show to first place,[17] she launched her own production company and became internationally syndicated.","Credited with creating a more intimate confessional form of media communication,[18] she is thought to have popularized and revolutionized[18][19] the tabloid talk show genre pioneered by Phil Donahue,[18] which a Yale study says broke 20th century taboos and allowed LGBT people to enter the mainstream.[20][21] By the mid-1990s, she had reinvented her show with a focus on literature, self-improvement, and spirituality. Though criticized for unleashing a confession culture, promoting controversial self-help ideas,[22] and an emotion-centered approach,[23] she is often praised for overcoming adversity to become a benefactor to others.[24] From 2006 to 2008, her endorsement of Obama, by one estimate, delivered over a million votes in the close 2008 Democratic primary race.[25]",,,"Winfrey was named ""Orpah"" on her birth certificate after the biblical figure in the Book of Ruth, but people mispronounced it regularly and ""Oprah"" stuck.[1]","Winfrey was born in Kosciusko, Mississippi, to an unmarried teenage mother. She later said that her conception was due to a single sexual encounter and the couple broke up not long after.[26] Her mother, Vernita Lee (born c. 1935), was a housemaid. Winfrey's biological father is usually noted as Vernon Winfrey (born 1933), a coal miner turned barber turned city councilman who had been in the Armed Forces when she was born. However, Mississippi farmer and World War II veteran Noah Robinson, Sr. (born c. 1925) has claimed to be her biological father.[27] A genetic test in 2006 determined that her matrilineal line originated among the Kpelle ethnic group, in the area that today is Liberia. Her genetic makeup was determined to be 89% Sub-Saharan African, 8% Native American, and 3% East Asian. However, the East Asian may, given the imprecision of genetic testing, actually be Native American markers.[28]","After Winfrey's birth, her mother traveled north and Winfrey spent her first six years living in rural poverty with her maternal grandmother, Hattie Mae (Presley) Lee (April 15, 1900 – February 27, 1963), who was so poor that Winfrey often wore dresses made of potato sacks, for which the local children made fun of her.[29][30] Her grandmother taught her to read before the age of three and took her to the local church, where she was nicknamed ""The Preacher"" for her ability to recite Bible verses. When Winfrey was a child, her grandmother would hit her with a stick when she did not do chores or if she misbehaved in any way.[31]","At age six, Winfrey moved to an inner-city neighborhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with her mother Vernita Lee, who was less supportive and encouraging than her grandmother had been, largely as a result of the long hours she worked as a maid.[32] Around this time, Lee had given birth to another daughter, Winfrey's younger half-sister, Patricia[33] who later (in February 2003, at age 43) died of causes related to cocaine addiction.[34] By 1962, Lee was having difficulty raising both daughters so Winfrey was temporarily sent to live with Vernon in Nashville, Tennessee.[35] While Winfrey was in Nashville, Lee gave birth to a third daughter[36] who was put up for adoption (in the hope of easing the financial straits that had led to Lee's being on welfare) and later also named Patricia.[37] Winfrey did not learn she had a second half-sister until 2010.[37] By the time Winfrey moved back in with Lee, Lee had also given birth to a boy named Jeffrey, Winfrey's half-brother, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1989.[34]","Winfrey has stated she was molested by her cousin, uncle, and a family friend, starting when she was nine years old, something she first announced to her viewers on a 1986 episode of her TV show regarding sexual abuse.[38][39] When Winfrey discussed the alleged abuse with family members at age 24, they refused to accept what she said.[40] Winfrey once commented that she had chosen not to be a mother because she had not been mothered well.[41]","At 13, after suffering years of abuse, Winfrey ran away from home.[1] When she was 14, she became pregnant but her son was born prematurely and he died shortly after birth.[42] Winfrey later stated she felt betrayed by the family member who had sold the story of her son to the National Enquirer in 1990.[43] She began going to Lincoln High School; but after early success in the Upward Bound program, was transferred to the affluent suburban Nicolet High School, where she says her poverty was constantly rubbed in her face as she rode the bus to school with fellow African-Americans, some of whom were servants of her classmates' families. She began to steal money from her mother in an effort to keep up with her free-spending peers, to lie to and argue with her mother, and to go out with older boys.[44]","Her frustrated mother once again sent her to live with Vernon in Nashville, Tennessee, though this time she did not take her back. Vernon was strict, but encouraging, and made her education a priority. Winfrey became an honors student, was voted Most Popular Girl, and joined her high school speech team at East Nashville High School, placing second in the nation in dramatic interpretation.[45] She won an oratory contest, which secured her a full scholarship to Tennessee State University, a historically black institution, where she studied communication. Her first job as a teenager was working at a local grocery store.[46] At the age of 17, Winfrey won the Miss Black Tennessee beauty pageant.[47] She also attracted the attention of the local black radio station, WVOL, which hired her to do the news part-time.[38] She worked there during her senior year of high school, and again while in her first two years of college.","Winfrey's career choice in media would not have surprised her grandmother, who once said that ever since Winfrey could talk, she was on stage. As a child, she played games interviewing her corncob doll and the crows on the fence of her family's property. Winfrey later acknowledged her grandmother's influence, saying it was Hattie Mae who had encouraged her to speak in public and ""gave me a positive sense of myself"".[48]","Working in local media, she was both the youngest news anchor and the first black female news anchor at Nashville's WLAC-TV. She moved to Baltimore's WJZ-TV in 1976 to co-anchor the six o'clock news. In 1977, she was removed as co-anchor and worked lower profile positions at the station. She was then recruited to join Richard Sher as co-host of WJZ's local talk show People Are Talking, which premiered on August 14, 1978. She also hosted the local version of Dialing for Dollars there.[49]","In 1983, Winfrey relocated to Chicago to host WLS-TV's low-rated half-hour morning talk show, AM Chicago. The first episode aired on January 2, 1984. Within months after Winfrey took over, the show went from last place in the ratings to overtaking Donahue as the highest-rated talk show in Chicago. The movie critic Roger Ebert persuaded her to sign a syndication deal with King World. Ebert predicted that she would generate 40 times as much revenue as his television show, At the Movies.[50] It was renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show, expanded to a full hour and broadcast nationally beginning September 8, 1986.[51] Winfrey's syndicated show brought in double Donahue's national audience, displacing Donahue as the number-one daytime talk show in America. Their much-publicized contest was the subject of enormous scrutiny. TIME magazine wrote:","TV columnist Howard Rosenberg said, ""She's a roundhouse, a full course meal, big, brassy, loud, aggressive, hyper, laughable, lovable, soulful, tender, low-down, earthy, and hungry. And she may know the way to Phil Donahue's jugular.""[53] Newsday's Les Payne observed, ""Oprah Winfrey is sharper than Donahue, wittier, more genuine, and far better attuned to her audience, if not the world""[53] and Martha Bayles of The Wall Street Journal wrote, ""It's a relief to see a gab-monger with a fond but realistic assessment of her own cultural and religious roots.""[53]","In the early years of The Oprah Winfrey Show, the program was classified as a tabloid talk show. In the mid-1990s, Winfrey adopted a less tabloid-oriented format, hosting shows on broader topics such as heart disease, geopolitics, spirituality, and meditation, interviewing celebrities on social issues they were directly involved with, such as cancer, charity work, or substance abuse, and hosting televised giveaways including shows where every audience member received a new car (donated by General Motors) or a trip to Australia (donated by Australian tourism bodies).[54] In addition to her talk show, Winfrey also produced and co-starred in the 1989 drama miniseries The Women of Brewster Place, as well as a short-lived spin-off, Brewster Place. As well as hosting and appearing on television shows, Winfrey co-founded the women's cable television network Oxygen. She is also the president of Harpo Productions (Oprah spelled backwards). On January 15, 2008, Winfrey and Discovery Communications announced plans to change Discovery Health Channel into a new channel called OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network. It was scheduled to launch in 2009 but was delayed, and actually launched on January 1, 2011.[55]","The series finale of The Oprah Winfrey Show aired on May 25, 2011.[56]","In January 2017, CBS revealed that Winfrey would join 60 Minutes as a special contributor on the Sunday evening news magazine program starting in the fall of 2017.[57]","In 1993, Winfrey hosted a rare prime-time interview with Michael Jackson, which became the fourth most-watched event in American television history as well as the most watched interview ever, with an audience of 36.5 million.[58] On December 1, 2005, Winfrey appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote the new Broadway musical The Color Purple,[59] of which she was a producer, joining the host for the first time in 16 years. The episode was hailed by some as the ""television event of the decade"" and helped Letterman attract his largest audience in more than 11 years: 13.45 million viewers.[60] Although a much-rumored feud was said to have been the cause of the rift,[clarification needed] both Winfrey and Letterman balked at such talk. ""I want you to know, it's really over, whatever you thought was happening"", said Winfrey. On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, as its season premiere was filmed in New York City.[61]","In 2006, rappers Ludacris, 50 Cent and Ice Cube criticized Winfrey for what they perceived as an anti-hip hop bias. In an interview with GQ magazine, Ludacris said that Winfrey gave him a ""hard time"" about his lyrics, and edited comments he made during an appearance on her show with the cast of the film Crash. He also said that he wasn't initially invited on the show with the rest of the cast.[62] Winfrey responded by saying that she is opposed to rap lyrics that ""marginalize women"", but enjoys some artists, including Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. In September 2008, Winfrey received criticism after Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report[63] reported that Winfrey refused to have Sarah Palin on her show, allegedly because of Winfrey's support for Barack Obama.[64] Winfrey denied the report, maintaining that there never was a discussion regarding Palin's appearing on her show.[64] She said that after she made public her support for Obama, she decided that she would not let her show be used as a platform for any of the candidates.[64] Although Obama appeared twice on her show, those appearances were prior to his declaring himself a candidate. Winfrey added that Palin would make a fantastic guest and that she would love to have her on the show after the election, which she did on November 18, 2009.[64]","In 2009, Winfrey was criticized for allowing actress Suzanne Somers to appear on her show to discuss hormone treatments that are not accepted by mainstream medicine.[65] Critics have also suggested that Winfrey is not tough enough when questioning celebrity guests or politicians whom she appears to like.[66] Lisa de Moraes, a media columnist for The Washington Post, stated: ""Oprah doesn't do follow-up questions unless you're an author who's embarrassed her by fabricating portions of a supposed memoir she's plugged for her book club.""[67]","In 1985, Winfrey co-starred in Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple as distraught housewife Sofia. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. The Alice Walker novel went on to become a Broadway musical which opened in late 2005, with Winfrey credited as a producer. In October 1998, Winfrey produced and starred in the film Beloved, based on Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. To prepare for her role as Sethe, the protagonist and former slave, Winfrey experienced a 24-hour simulation of the experience of slavery, which included being tied up and blindfolded and left alone in the woods. Despite major advertising, including two episodes of her talk show dedicated solely to the film, and moderate to good critical reviews, Beloved opened to poor box-office results, losing approximately $30 million. While promoting the movie, co-star Thandie Newton described Winfrey as ""a very strong technical actress and it's because she's so smart. She's acute. She's got a mind like a razor blade.""[68] In 2005, Harpo Productions released a film adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 novel Their Eyes Were Watching God. The made-for-television film was based upon a teleplay by Suzan-Lori Parks and starred Halle Berry in the lead female role.","In late 2008, Winfrey's company Harpo Films signed an exclusive output pact to develop and produce scripted series, documentaries, and movies for HBO.[69] Oprah voiced Gussie the goose for Charlotte's Web (2006) and the voice of Judge Bumbleden in Bee Movie (2007) co-starring the voices of Jerry Seinfeld and Renée Zellweger. In 2009, Winfrey provided the voice for the character of Eudora, the mother of Princess Tiana, in Disney's The Princess and the Frog and in 2010, narrated the US version of the BBC nature program Life for Discovery.","Winfrey has co-authored five books. At the announcement of a weight loss book in 2005, co-authored with her personal trainer Bob Greene, it was said that her undisclosed advance fee had broken the record for the world's highest book advance fee, previously held by the autobiography of former U.S. President Bill Clinton.[70]","Her memoir, The Life You Want, is scheduled for publication in 2017.[71]","Winfrey publishes magazines: O, The Oprah Magazine; from 2004 to 2008, she also published a magazine called O at Home.[72] In 2002, Fortune called O, the Oprah Magazine the most successful start-up ever in the industry.[73] Although its circulation had declined by more than 10 percent (to 2.4 million) from 2005 to 2008,[74] the January 2009 issue was the best selling issue since 2006.[75] The audience for her magazine is considerably more upscale than for her TV show, the average reader earning well above the median for U.S. women.[73]","Winfrey's company created the Oprah.com website to provide resources and interactive content relating to her shows, magazines, book club, and public charity. Oprah.com averages more than 70 million page views and more than six million users per month, and receives approximately 20,000 e-mails each week.[76] Winfrey initiated ""Oprah's Child Predator Watch List"", through her show and website, to help track down accused child molesters. Within the first 48 hours, two of the featured men were captured.[77]","On February 9, 2006, it was announced that Winfrey had signed a three-year, $55 million contract with XM Satellite Radio to establish a new radio channel. The channel, Oprah Radio, features popular contributors to The Oprah Winfrey Show and O, The Oprah Magazine including Nate Berkus, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Bob Greene, Dr. Robin Smith, and Marianne Williamson. Oprah & Friends began broadcasting at 11:00 am ET, September 25, 2006, from a new studio at Winfrey's Chicago headquarters. The channel broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week on XM Radio Channel 156. Winfrey's contract requires her to be on the air 30 minutes a week, 39 weeks a year.","Winfrey currently lives on ""The Promised Land"", her 42-acre (17 ha) estate with ocean and mountain views in Montecito, California. Winfrey also owns a house in Lavallette, New Jersey; an apartment in Chicago; an estate on Fisher Island, Florida; a ski house in Telluride, Colorado; and property on Maui, Hawaii and Antigua. Her base during filming of Winfrey's show is Chicago.","A self-described promiscuous teen who was a victim of sexual abuse, Winfrey gave birth at the age of 14 to a boy who died shortly after.[16]","Winfrey's high school sweetheart Anthony Otey recalled an innocent courtship that began in Winfrey's senior year of high school, from which he saved hundreds of love notes; Winfrey conducted herself with dignity and as a model student.[78] The two spoke of getting married, but Otey claimed to have always secretly known that Winfrey was destined for a far greater life than he could ever provide.[79] She broke up with him on Valentine's Day of her senior year.[79][80]","In 1971, several months after breaking up with Otey, Winfrey met William ""Bubba"" Taylor at Tennessee State University. According to CBS journalist George Mair, Taylor was Winfrey's ""first intense, to die for love affair"". Winfrey helped get Taylor a job at WVOL, and according to Mair, ""did everything to keep him, including literally begging him on her knees to stay with her.""[81] Taylor, however, was unwilling to leave Nashville with Winfrey when she moved to Baltimore to work at WJZ-TV in June 1976. ""We really did care for each other"", Winfrey would later recall. ""We shared a deep love. A love I will never forget.""[82]","In the 1970s, Winfrey had a romantic relationship with John Tesh. Biographer Kitty Kelley claims that Tesh split with Winfrey over the pressure of having an interracial relationship.[83]","When WJZ-TV management criticized Winfrey for crying on the air while reporting tragedies and were unhappy with her physical appearance (especially when her hair fell out as the result of a bad perm), Winfrey turned to reporter Lloyd Kramer for comfort. ""Lloyd was just the best"", Winfrey would later recall. ""That man loved me even when I was bald! He was wonderful. He stuck with me through the whole demoralizing experience. That man was the most fun romance I ever had.""[84]","According to Mair, when Kramer moved to NBC in New York, Winfrey had a love affair with a married man who had no intention of leaving his wife.[85] Winfrey would later recall: ""I'd had a relationship with a man for four years. I wasn't living with him. I'd never lived with anyone—and I thought I was worthless without him. The more he rejected me, the more I wanted him. I felt depleted, powerless. At the end, I was down on the floor on my knees groveling and pleading with him"".[86] Winfrey became so depressed that on September 8, 1981, she wrote a suicide note to best friend Gayle King instructing King to water her plants.[86] ""That suicide note had been much overplayed"" Winfrey told Ms. magazine. ""I couldn't kill myself. I would be afraid the minute I did it; something really good would happen and I'd miss it.""[87]","According to Winfrey, her emotional turmoil gradually led to a weight problem: ""The reason I gained so much weight in the first place and the reason I had such a sorry history of abusive relationships with men was I just needed approval so much. I needed everyone to like me, because I didn't like myself much. So I'd end up with these cruel self-absorbed guys who'd tell me how selfish I was, and I'd say 'Oh thank you, you're so right' and be grateful to them. Because I had no sense that I deserved anything else. Which is also why I gained so much weight later on. It was the perfect way of cushioning myself against the world's disapproval.""[87]","Winfrey later confessed to smoking crack cocaine with a man she was romantically involved with during the same era. She explained on her show: ""I always felt that the drug itself is not the problem but that I was addicted to the man."" She added: ""I can't think of anything I wouldn't have done for that man.""[88]","Winfrey was allegedly involved in a second drug-related love affair. Self-proclaimed former boyfriend Randoph Cook said they lived together for several months in 1985 and did drugs. In 1997, Cook tried to sue Winfrey for $20 million for allegedly blocking a tell-all book about their alleged relationship.[89][90]","Also, in the mid-1980s, Winfrey briefly dated movie critic Roger Ebert, whom she credits with advising her to take her show into syndication.[50]","In 1985, before Winfrey's Chicago talk show had gone national, Haitian filmmaker Reginald Chevalier claims he appeared as a guest on a look-alike segment and began a relationship with Winfrey involving romantic evenings at home, candlelit baths, and dinners with Michael Jordan and Danny Glover. Chevalier says Winfrey ended the relationship when she met Stedman Graham.[91]","Winfrey and her boyfriend Stedman Graham have been together since 1986. They were engaged to be married in November 1992, but the ceremony never took place.[92]","Winfrey's best friend since their early twenties is Gayle King. King was formerly the host of The Gayle King Show and is currently an editor of O, the Oprah Magazine. Since 1997, when Winfrey played the therapist on an episode of the sitcom Ellen in which Ellen DeGeneres came out of the closet, Winfrey and King have been the target of persistent rumors that they were gay. ""I understand why people think we're gay"", Winfrey says in the August 2006 issue of O magazine. ""There isn't a definition in our culture for this kind of bond between women. So I get why people have to label it—how can you be this close without it being sexual?""[93] ""I've told nearly everything there is to tell. All my stuff is out there. People think I'd be so ashamed of being gay that I wouldn't admit it? Oh, please.""[93]","Winfrey has also had a long friendship with Maria Shriver, after they met in Baltimore.[94][95] Winfrey considered Maya Angelou, author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, her mentor and close friend; she called Angelou her ""mother-sister-friend.""[96] Winfrey hosted a week-long Caribbean cruise for Angelou and 150 guests for Angelou's 70th birthday in 1998, and in 2008, threw her ""an extravagant 80th birthday celebration"" at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.[97]","Born in rural poverty, and raised by a mother dependent on government welfare payments in a poor urban neighbourhood, Winfrey became a millionaire at the age of 32 when her talk show received national syndication. Winfrey negotiated ownership rights to the television program and started her own production company. At the age of 41, Winfrey had a net worth of $340 million and replaced Bill Cosby as the only African American on the Forbes 400.[98] With a 2000 net worth of $800 million, Winfrey is believed to be the richest African American of the 20th century. There has been a course taught at the University of Illinois focussing on Winfrey's business acumen, namely: ""History 298: Oprah Winfrey, the Tycoon"".[99] Winfrey was the highest paid TV entertainer in the United States in 2006, earning an estimated $260 million during the year, five times the sum earned by second-place music executive Simon Cowell.[100] By 2008, her yearly income had increased to $275 million.[101]","Forbes' international rich list has listed Winfrey as the world's only black billionaire from 2004 to 2006 and as the first black woman billionaire in world history.[98] As of 2014, Winfrey has a net worth in excess of 2.9 billion dollars[102] and has overtaken former eBay CEO Meg Whitman as the richest self-made woman in America.[103]","Oprah was raised a Baptist. She was quoted as saying: I have a church with myself: I have church walking down the street. I believe in God force that lives inside all of us, and once you tap into that, you can do anything.[104]","Winfrey was called ""arguably the world's most powerful woman"" by CNN and Time.com,[105] ""arguably the most influential woman in the world"" by The American Spectator,[106] ""one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th Century"" and ""one of the most influential people"" from 2004 to 2011 by TIME. Winfrey is the only person in the world to have appeared in the latter list on ten occasions.[107]","At the end of the 20th century, Life listed Winfrey as both the most influential woman and the most influential black person of her generation, and in a cover story profile the magazine called her ""America's most powerful woman"".[108] In 2007, USA Today ranked Winfrey as the most influential woman and most influential black person of the previous quarter-century.[109] Ladies Home Journal also ranked Winfrey number one in their list of the most powerful women in America and Senator Barack Obama has said she ""may be the most influential woman in the country"".[110] In 1998, Winfrey became the first woman and first African American to top Entertainment Weekly's list of the 101 most powerful people in the entertainment industry.[111] Forbes named her the world's most powerful celebrity in 2005,[112] 2007,[113] 2008,[101] 2010,[114] and 2013.[115] As chairman of Harpo Inc., she was named the most powerful woman in entertainment by The Hollywood Reporter in 2008.[116] She has also been listed as one of the most powerful 100 women in the world by Forbes, ranking fourteenth in 2014.[117] In 2010, Life magazine named Winfrey one of the 100 people who changed the world, alongside such luminaries as Jesus Christ, Elvis Presley and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Winfrey was the only living woman to make the list.[118]","Columnist Maureen Dowd seems to agree with such assessments: ""She is the top alpha female in this country. She has more credibility than the president. Other successful women, such as Hillary Clinton and Martha Stewart, had to be publicly slapped down before they could move forward. Even Condi has had to play the protegé with Bush. None of this happened to Oprah – she is a straight ahead success story.[119] Vanity Fair wrote: ""Oprah Winfrey arguably has more influence on the culture than any university president, politician, or religious leader, except perhaps the Pope.[120] Bill O'Reilly said: ""this is a woman that came from nothing to rise up to be the most powerful woman, I think, in the world. I think Oprah Winfrey is the most powerful woman in the world, not just in America. That's – anybody who goes on her program immediately benefits through the roof. I mean, she has a loyal following; she has credibility; she has talent; and she's done it on her own to become fabulously wealthy and fabulously powerful.""[121]","In 2005, Winfrey was named the greatest woman in American history as part of a public poll as part of The Greatest American. She was ranked No. 9 overall on the list of greatest Americans. However, polls estimating Winfrey's personal popularity have been inconsistent. A November 2003 Gallup poll estimated that 73% of American adults had a favorable view of Winfrey. Another Gallup poll in January 2007 estimated the figure at 74%, although it dropped to 66% when Gallup conducted the same poll in October 2007. A December 2007 Fox News poll put the figure at 55%.[122] According to Gallup's annual most admired poll, Americans consistently rank Winfrey as one of the most admired women in the world. Her highest rating came in 2007[123] when she was statistically tied with Hillary Clinton for first place.[124] In a list compiled by the British magazine New Statesman in September 2010, she was voted 38th in the list of ""The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010"".[125]","In 1989, she was accepted into the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame.[126]","The Wall Street Journal coined the term ""Oprahfication"", meaning public confession as a form of therapy.[127] By confessing intimate details about her weight problems, tumultuous love life, and sexual abuse, and crying alongside her guests, Time magazine credits Winfrey with creating a new form of media communication known as ""rapport talk"" as distinguished from the ""report talk"" of Phil Donahue: ""Winfrey saw television's power to blend public and private; while it links strangers and conveys information over public airwaves, TV is most often viewed in the privacy of our homes. Like a family member, it sits down to meals with us and talks to us in the lonely afternoons. Grasping this paradox, ... She makes people care because she cares. That is Winfrey's genius, and will be her legacy, as the changes she has wrought in the talk show continue to permeate our culture and shape our lives.""[128]","Observers have also noted the ""Oprahfication"" of politics such as ""Oprah-style debates"" and Bill Clinton being described as ""the man who brought Oprah-style psychobabble and misty confessions to politics.""[129] Newsweek stated: ""Every time a politician lets his lip quiver or a cable anchor 'emotes' on TV, they nod to the cult of confession that Oprah helped create.[130] Winfrey's disclosures about her weight (which peaked at 108 kg (238 lb)) also paved the way for other plus-sized women in media[citation needed] such as Roseanne Barr, Rosie O'Donnell and Star Jones. The November 1988 Ms. observed that ""in a society where fat is taboo, she made it in a medium that worships thin and celebrates a bland, white-bread prettiness of body and personality [...] But Winfrey made fat sexy, elegant – damned near gorgeous – with her drop-dead wardrobe, easy body language, and cheerful sensuality.""[131]","While Phil Donahue has been credited with pioneering the tabloid talk show genre, Winfrey's warmth, intimacy and personal confession popularized and changed it.[18][19] Her success at popularizing of the tabloid talk show genre had opened up a thriving industry that has included Ricki Lake, The Jenny Jones Show, and The Jerry Springer Show. Sociologists such as Vicki Abt criticized tabloid talk shows for redefining social norms. In her book Coming After Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV talk show, Abt warned that the media revolution that followed Winfrey's success was blurring the lines between ""normal"" and ""deviant"" behavior. In the book Freaks Talk Back,[20] Yale sociology professor Joshua Gamson credits the tabloid talk show genre with providing much needed high impact media visibility for gay, bisexual, transsexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and doing more to make them mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century. In the book's editorial review Michael Bronski wrote, ""In the recent past, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered people had almost no presence on television. With the invention and propagation of tabloid talk shows such as Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones, Oprah, and Geraldo, people outside the sexual mainstream now appear in living rooms across America almost every day of the week.""[132] Gamson credits the tabloid talk show with making alternative sexual orientations and identities more acceptable in mainstream society. Examples include a Time magazine article[page needed] describing early 21st-century gays coming out of the closet younger and younger and gay suicide rates plummeting. Gamson also believes that tabloid talk shows caused gays to be embraced on more traditional forms of media. Examples include sitcoms like Will & Grace, primetime shows like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Oscar-nominated feature films like Boys Don't Cry and Brokeback Mountain.[citation needed]","In April 1997, Winfrey played the therapist in ""The Puppy Episode"" on the sitcom Ellen to whom the character (and the real-life Ellen DeGeneres) said she was a lesbian.","The power of Winfrey's opinions and endorsement to influence public opinion, especially consumer purchasing choices, has been dubbed ""The Oprah Effect"".[133] The effect has been documented or alleged in domains as diverse as book sales, beef markets, and election voting. Late in 1996,[134] Winfrey introduced the Oprah's Book Club segment to her television show. The segment focused on new books and classics and often brought obscure novels to popular attention. The book club became such a powerful force that whenever Winfrey introduced a new book as her book-club selection, it instantly became a best-seller; for example, when she selected the classic John Steinbeck novel East of Eden, it soared to the top of the book charts. Being recognized by Winfrey often means a million additional book sales for an author.[135] In Reading with Oprah: The Book Club that Changed America (2005), Kathleen Rooney describes Winfrey as ""a serious American intellectual who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically television and the Internet, to take reading – a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act – and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books.""","When author Jonathan Franzen's book was selected for the Book Club, he reportedly ""cringed"" and said selected books tend to be ""schmaltzy"".[136] After James Frey's A Million Little Pieces was found to contain fabrications in 2006, Winfrey confronted him on her show over the breach of trust. In 2009, Winfrey apologized to Frey for the public confrontation.[137] During a show about mad cow disease with Howard Lyman (aired on April 16, 1996), Winfrey said she was stopped cold from eating another burger. Texas cattlemen sued her and Lyman in early 1998 for ""false defamation of perishable food"" and ""business disparagement"", claiming that Winfrey's remarks sent cattle prices tumbling, costing beef producers $11 million. Winfrey was represented by attorney Chip Babcock and, on February 26, after a two-month trial in an Amarillo, Texas, court, a jury found Winfrey and Lyman were not liable for damages.[138][139] During the lawsuit, Winfrey hired Phil McGraw's company Courtroom Sciences, Inc. to help her analyze and read the jury.[140] Winfrey's ability to launch other successful talk shows such as Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz, and Rachael Ray has also been cited as examples of ""The Oprah Effect"".[141]","Winfrey endorsed presidential candidate Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election,[142][143][144] the first time she endorsed a political candidate running for office.[145] Winfrey held a fundraiser for Obama on September 8, 2007, at her Santa Barbara estate. In December 2007, Winfrey joined Obama for a series of rallies in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. The Columbia, South Carolina event on December 9, 2007, drew a crowd of nearly 30,000, the largest for any political event of 2007.[146] An analysis by two economists at the University of Maryland, College Park estimated that Winfrey's endorsement was responsible for between 420,000 and 1,600,000 votes for Obama in the Democratic primary alone, based on a sample of states that did not include Texas, Michigan, North Dakota, Kansas, or Alaska. The results suggest that in the sampled states, Winfrey's endorsement was responsible for the difference in the popular vote between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.[147] The governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich, reported being so impressed by Winfrey's endorsement that he considered offering Winfrey Obama's vacant senate seat describing Winfrey as ""the most instrumental person in electing Barack Obama president"", with ""a voice larger than all 100 senators combined"".[148] Winfrey responded by stating that although she was absolutely not interested, she did feel she could be a senator.[149]","In April 2014, Winfrey spoke for more than 20 minutes at a fundraiser in Arlington, Virginia, for Lavern Chatman, a candidate in a primary to nominate a Democratic Party candidate for election to the U.S. House of Representatives. Winfrey participated in the event even after reports had revealed that Chatman had been found liable in 2001 for her role in a scheme to defraud hundreds of District of Columbia nursing home employees of at least $1.4 million in owed wages.[150]","In 2000, she was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.[151] In 2002, Christianity Today published an article called ""The Church of O"" in which they concluded that Winfrey had emerged as an influential spiritual leader. ""Since 1994, when she abandoned traditional talk-show fare for more edifying content, and 1998, when she began 'Change Your Life TV', Oprah's most significant role has become that of a spiritual leader. To her audience of more than 22 million mostly female viewers, she has become a postmodern priestess—an icon of church-free spirituality.""[127] The sentiment was echoed by Marcia Z. Nelson in her book The Gospel According to Oprah.[152] Since the mid-1990s, Winfrey's show has emphasized uplifting and inspirational topics and themes and some viewers say the show has motivated them to perform acts of altruism such as helping Congolese women and building an orphanage.[153] A scientific study by psychological scientists at the University of Cambridge, University of Plymouth, and University of California used an uplifting clip from The Oprah Winfrey Show in an experiment that discovered that watching the 'uplifting' clip caused subjects to become twice as helpful as subjects assigned to watch a British comedy or nature documentary.[154][155]","In 1998, Winfrey began an ongoing conversation with Gary Zukav, an American spiritual teacher, who appeared on her television show 35 times.[156] Winfrey has said she keeps a copy of Zukav's The Seat of the Soul at her bedside, a book that she says is one of her all-time favorites.[157]","On the season premier of Winfrey's 13th season, Roseanne Barr told Winfrey ""you're the African Mother Goddess of us all"" inspiring much enthusiasm from the studio audience. The animated series Futurama alluded to her spiritual influence by suggesting that ""Oprahism"" is a mainstream religion in 3000 AD.[158] Twelve days after the September 11 attacks, New York mayor Rudy Giuliani asked Winfrey to serve as host of a Prayer for America service at New York city's Yankee Stadium which was attended by former president Bill Clinton and New York senator Hillary Clinton.[159] Leading up to the U.S.-led 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, less than a month after the September 11 attacks, Winfrey aired a controversial show called ""Islam 101"" in which she portrayed Islam as a religion of peace, calling it ""the most misunderstood of the three major religions"".[160] In 2002, George W. Bush invited Winfrey to join a US delegation that included adviser Karen Hughes and Condoleezza Rice, planning to go to Afghanistan to celebrate the return of Afghan girls to school. The ""Oprah strategy"" was designed to portray the War on Terror in a positive light, however, when Winfrey refused to participate, the trip was postponed.[161]","Leading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, Winfrey's show received criticism for allegedly having an anti-war bias. Ben Shapiro of Townhall.com wrote: ""Oprah Winfrey is the most powerful woman in America. She decides what makes the New York Times best-seller lists. Her touchy-feely style sucks in audiences at the rate of 14 million viewers per day. But Oprah is far more than a cultural force, she's a dangerous political force as well, a woman with unpredictable and mercurial attitudes toward the major issues of the day.""[162] In 2006, Winfrey recalled such controversies: ""I once did a show titled Is War the Only Answer? In the history of my career, I've never received more hate mail – like 'Go back to Africa' hate mail. I was accused of being un-American for even raising the question.""[163] Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore came to Winfrey's defence, praising her for showing antiwar footage no other media would show[164] and begging her to run for president.[165] A February 2003 series, in which Winfrey showed clips from people all over the world asking America not to go to war, was interrupted in several east coast markets by network broadcasts of a press conference in which President George W. Bush and Colin Powell summarized the case for war.[166][167]","In 2007, Winfrey began to endorse the self-help program The Secret. The Secret claims that people can change their lives through positive thoughts or 'vibrations', which will then cause them to attract more positive vibrations that result in good things happening to them. Peter Birkenhead of Salon magazine argued that this idea is pseudoscience and psychologically damaging, as it trivializes important decisions and promotes a quick-fix material culture, and suggest Winfrey's promotion of it is irresponsible given her influence.[168] In 2007, skeptic and magician James Randi accused Winfrey of being deliberately deceptive and uncritical in how she handles paranormal claims on her show.[169] In 2008, Winfrey endorsed author and spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle and his book, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose, which sold several million extra copies after being selected for her book club. During a Webinar class, in which she promoted the book, Winfrey stated ""God is a feeling experience and not a believing experience. If your religion is a believing experience [...] then that's not truly God.""[170] Frank Pastore, a Christian radio talk show host on KKLA, was among the many Christian leaders who criticized Winfrey's views, saying ""if she's a Christian, she's an ignorant one because Christianity is incompatible with New Age thought.""[170]","Winfrey was named as the 2008 Person of the Year by animal-rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) for using her fame and listening audience to help the less fortunate, including animals. PETA praised Winfrey for using her talk show to uncover horrific cases of cruelty to animals in puppy mills and on factory farms, and Winfrey even used the show to highlight the cruelty-free vegan diet that she tried.[171] Winfrey also refuses to wear fur or feature it in her magazine.[172]","In 2009, Winfrey filmed a series of interviews in Denmark highlighting its citizens as the happiest people in the world. In 2010, Bill O'Reilly of Fox News criticized these shows for promoting a left-wing society.[173]","On using the N-word, Winfrey said, ""You cannot be my friend and use that word around me. ... I always think of the...people who heard that as their last word as they were hanging from a tree.""[174]","The viewership for The Oprah Winfrey Show was highest during the 1991–92 season, when about 13.1 million U.S. viewers were watching each day. By 2003, ratings declined to 7.4 million daily viewers.[175] Ratings briefly rebounded to approximately 9 million in 2005 and then declined again to around 7.3 million viewers in 2008, though it remained the highest rated talk show.[176] In 2008, Winfrey's show was airing in 140 countries internationally and seen by an estimated 46 million people in the US weekly.[177][178] According to the Harris poll, Winfrey was America's favorite television personality in 1998, 2000, 2002–06, and 2009. Winfrey was especially popular among women, Democrats, political moderates, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Southern Americans, and East Coast Americans.[179]","Outside the U.S., Winfrey has become increasingly popular in the Arab world. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2007 that MBC 4, an Arab satellite channel, centered its entire programming around reruns of her show because it was drawing record numbers of female viewers in Saudi Arabia.[180] In 2008, The New York Times reported that The Oprah Winfrey Show, with Arabic subtitles, was broadcast twice each weekday on MBC 4. Winfrey's modest dress, combined with her attitude of triumph over adversity and abuse has caused some women in Saudi Arabia to idealize her.[181]","In 2004, Winfrey became the first black person to rank among the 50 most generous Americans[182] and she remained among the top 50 until 2010.[183] By 2012, she had given away about $400 million to educational causes.[184]","As of 2012, Winfrey had also given over 400 scholarships to Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.[102] Winfrey was the recipient of the first Bob Hope Humanitarian Award at 2002 Emmy Awards for services to television and film. To celebrate two decades on national TV, and to thank her employees for their hard work, Winfrey took her staff and their families (1065 people in total) on vacation to Hawaii in the summer of 2006.[185]","In 2013, Winfrey donated $12 million to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.[186] President Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom later that same year.[187]","In 1998, Winfrey created the Oprah's Angel Network, a charity that supported charitable projects and provided grants to nonprofit organizations around the world. Oprah's Angel Network raised more than $80,000,000 ($1 million of which was donated by Jon Bon Jovi). Winfrey personally covered all administrative costs associated with the charity, so 100% of all funds raised went to charity programs. In May 2010, with Oprah's show ending, the charity stopped accepting donations and was shut down.[188] [189]","In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Oprah created the Oprah Angel Network Katrina registry which raised more than $11 million for relief efforts. Winfrey personally gave $10 million to the cause.[190] Homes were built in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama before the one-year anniversary of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[191]","In 2004, Winfrey and her team filmed an episode of her show, Oprah's Christmas Kindness, in which Winfrey travelled to South Africa to bring attention to the plight of young children affected by poverty and AIDS. During the 21-day trip, Winfrey and her crew visited schools and orphanages in poverty-stricken areas, and distributed Christmas presents to 50,000 children,[192] with dolls for the girls and soccer balls for the boys, and school supplies. Throughout the show, Winfrey appealed to viewers to donate money to Oprah's Angel Network for poor and AIDS-affected children in Africa. From that show alone, viewers around the world donated over $7,000,000. Winfrey invested $40 million and some of her time establishing the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in Henley on Klip south of Johannesburg, South Africa. The school set over 22 acres, opened in January 2007 with an enrollment of 150 pupils (increasing to 450) and features state-of-the-art classrooms, computer and science laboratories, a library, theatre, and beauty salon. Nelson Mandela praised Winfrey for overcoming her own disadvantaged youth to become a benefactor for others. Critics considered the school elitist and unnecessarily luxurious.[193] Winfrey rejected the claims, saying: ""If you are surrounded by beautiful things and wonderful teachers who inspire you, that beauty brings out the beauty in you.""[193] Winfrey, who has no surviving biological children, described maternal feelings towards the girls at Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls.[194][195] Winfrey teaches a class at the school via satellite.[194]"
The_New_York_Times,"The New York Times (sometimes abbreviated NYT and The Times) is an American daily newspaper, founded and continuously published in New York City since September 18, 1851, by The New York Times Company. The New York Times has won 122 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper.[5][6][7][8]","The paper's print version in 2013 had the second-largest circulation, behind The Wall Street Journal, and the largest circulation among the metropolitan newspapers in the US. The New York Times is ranked 18th in the world by circulation. Following industry trends, its weekday circulation had fallen in 2009 to fewer than one million.[9]","Nicknamed ""The Gray Lady"",[10] The New York Times has long been regarded within the industry as a national ""newspaper of record"".[11] It has been owned by the Ochs-Sulzberger family since 1896; Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., the publisher of the Times and the chairman of the New York Times Company, is the fourth generation of the family to helm the paper.[12] The New York Times international version, formerly the International Herald Tribune, is now called the New York Times International Edition.[13]","The paper's motto, ""All the News That's Fit to Print"", appears in the upper left-hand corner of the front page. Since the mid-1970s, The New York Times has greatly expanded its layout and organization, adding special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and features. Since 2008,[14] The New York Times has been organized into the following sections: News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Sports of The Times, Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features.[15]","On Sunday, The New York Times is supplemented by the Sunday Review (formerly the Week in Review),[16] The New York Times Book Review,[17] The New York Times Magazine[18] and T: The New York Times Style Magazine (T is published 13 times a year).[19] The New York Times stayed with the broadsheet full page set-up (as some others have changed into a tabloid lay-out) and an eight-column format for several years, after most papers switched to six,[20] and was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, especially on the front page.[21]","The New York Times was founded as the New-York Daily Times on September 18, 1851,[a] published by Raymond, Jones & Company (raising about $70,000);[23] by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond (1820–69), then a Whig Party member and later second chairman of the newly organized Republican Party National Committee, and former banker George Jones. Some other early investors of the company were Edwin B. Morgan[24] and Edward B. Wesley.[25] Sold for a penny (equivalent to 29 cents today), the inaugural edition attempted to address various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release:[26]","We shall be Conservative, in all cases where we think Conservatism essential to the public good;—and we shall be Radical in everything which may seem to us to require radical treatment and radical reform. We do not believe that everything in Society is either exactly right or exactly wrong;—what is good we desire to preserve and improve;—what is evil, to exterminate, or reform.","In 1852, the newspaper started a western division, The Times of California that arrived whenever a mail boat got to California. However, when local California newspapers came into prominence, the effort failed.[27]","The newspaper shortened its name to The New-York Times in 1857. It dropped the hyphen in the city name in the 1890s.[28] On April 21, 1861, The New York Times departed from its original Monday–Saturday publishing schedule and joined other major dailies in adding a Sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the Civil War. One of the earliest public controversies it was involved with was the Mortara Affair, the subject of twenty editorials it published alone.[29]","The main office of The New York Times was attacked during the New York Draft Riots sparked by the beginning of military conscription for the Northern Union Army now instituted in the midst of the Civil War on July 13, 1863. At ""Newspaper Row"", across from City Hall, Henry Raymond, owner and editor of The New York Times, averted the rioters with ""Gatling"" (early machine, rapid-firing) guns, one of which he manned himself. The mob now diverted, instead attacked the headquarters of abolitionist publisher Horace Greeley's New York Tribune until forced to flee by the Brooklyn City Police, who had crossed the East River to help the Manhattan authorities.[30]","In 1869, Raymond died, and George Jones took over as publisher.[31]","The newspaper's influence grew during 1870–1 when it published a series of exposés on William Magear (""Boss"") Tweed, leader of the city's Democratic Party—popularly known as ""Tammany Hall"" (from its early 19th Century meeting headquarters)—that led to the end of the ""Tweed Ring's"" domination of New York's City Hall.[32] Tweed offered The New York Times five million dollars (equivalent to more than 100 million dollars today) to not publish the story.[24] In the 1880s, The New York Times transitioned gradually from editorially supporting Republican Party candidates to becoming more politically independent and analytical.[33] In 1884, the paper supported Democrat Grover Cleveland (former Mayor of Buffalo and Governor of New York State) in his first presidential campaign.[34] While this move cost The New York Times' readership among its more progressive and Republican readers (the revenue went down from $188,000 to $56,000 from 1883-4- however some part of this was due to the price going down to two cents, in order to compete with the World and Sun), the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years.[35] After George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller raised $1 million dollars to buy the Times, along with other fellow editors at the newspaper, printing it under the New York Times Publishing Company.[36][37] However, the newspaper was financially crippled by the Panic of 1893.[35] By 1896, The New York Times had a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day when controlling interest in it was gained by Adolph Ochs, publisher of the Chattanooga Times for $75,000.[38]","Shortly after assuming control of the paper, Ochs coined the paper's slogan, ""All The News That's Fit To Print"". The slogan has been printed in a box in the upper left hand corner of the front page since early 1897.[34] This was a jab at competing papers such as Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal which were now being known for a lurid, sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions known by the end of the century as ""yellow journalism"".[39] Under Ochs' guidance, continuing and expanding upon the Henry Raymond tradition, (which were from the era of James Gordon Bennett of the New York Herald which predated Pulitzer and Hearst's arrival in New York), The New York Times achieved international scope, circulation, and reputation (the Sunday circulation went from 9,000 in 1896 to 780,000 in 1934).[38] In 1904, The New York Times, along with The Times received the first on-the-spot wireless telegraph transmission from a naval battle, a report of the destruction of the Imperial Russian Navy's Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Port Arthur in the Straits of Tsushima off the eastern coast of Korea in the Yellow Sea in the western Pacific Ocean after just sailing across the globe from Europe from the press-boat Haimun during the Russo-Japanese War .[40] In 1910, the first air delivery of The New York Times to Philadelphia began.[34] The New York Times' first trans-Atlantic delivery by air to London occurred in 1919 by dirigible. In 1920, a ""4 A.M. Airplane Edition"" was sent by plane to Chicago so it could be in the hands of Republican convention delegates by evening.[41]","In the 1940s, the paper extended its breadth and reach. The crossword began appearing regularly in 1942, and the fashion section in 1946. The New York Times began an international edition in 1946. The international edition stopped publishing in 1967, when The New York Times joined the owners of the New York Herald Tribune and The Washington Post to publish the International Herald Tribune in Paris. The paper bought AM radio station WQXR (1560 kHz) in 1944.[42] Its ""sister"" FM station, WQXQ, would become WQXR-FM (96.3 MHz). Branded as ""The Radio Stations of The New York Times"", its classical music radio format was simulcast on both the AM & FM frequencies until December 1992, when the big-band and pop standards music format of station WNEW (1130 kHz – now WBBR/""Bloomberg Radio"") was transferred to and adopted by WQXR; in recognition of the format change, WQXR changed its call letters to WQEW (a ""hybrid"" combination of ""WQXR"" and ""WNEW"").[43] By 1999, The New York Times was leasing WQEW to ABC Radio for its ""Radio Disney"" format.[44] In 2007, WQEW was finally purchased by Disney; in late 2014, it was sold to Family Radio (a religious radio network) and became WFME.[45] On July 14, 2009, it was announced that WQXR-FM would be sold to the WNYC radio group who, on October 8, 2009, moved the station from 96.3 to 105.9 MHz (swapping frequencies with Spanish-language station WXNY-FM, which wanted the more powerful transmitter to increase its coverage) and began operating it as a non-commercial, public radio station.[46] After the purchase, WQXR-FM retained the classical music format, whereas WNYC-FM (93.9 MHz) abandoned it, switching to a talk radio format.","On September 14, 1987, the Times printed the heaviest ever newspaper, at over 12 pounds (5.4 kg) and 1,612 pages.[47]","In 2009, the newspaper began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area. Beginning October 16, 2009, a two-page ""Bay Area"" insert was added to copies of the Northern California edition on Fridays and Sundays. The newspaper commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20, 2009. The inserts consist of local news, policy, sports, and culture pieces, usually supported by local advertisements.","In addition to its New York City headquarters, the newspaper has ten news bureaus in the New York region, eleven national news bureaus and 26 foreign news bureaus.[48] The New York Times reduced its page width to 12 inches (300 mm) from 13.5 inches (340 mm) on August 6, 2007, adopting the width that has become the U.S. newspaper industry standard.[49]","Because of its steadily declining sales attributed to the rise of online alternative media and social media, the newspaper has been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses,[50] in common with a general trend among print news media.[51]","In 2016, reporters for the newspaper were reportedly the target of cyber security breaches. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was reportedly investigating the attacks. The cyber security breaches have been described as possibly being related to cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee.[52]","The newspaper's first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858 to 41 Park Row, making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use.[53]","The newspaper moved its headquarters to the Times Tower, located at 1475 Broadway in 1904,[54] in an area called Longacre Square, that was later renamed Times Square in honor of the newspaper.[55] The top of the building –  now known as One Times Square –  is the site of the New Year's Eve tradition of lowering a lighted ball, which was started by the paper.[56] The building is also notable for its electronic news ticker –  popularly known as ""The Zipper"" –  where headlines crawl around the outside of the building.[57] It is still in use, but has been operated by Dow Jones & Company since 1995.[58] After nine years in its Times Square tower the newspaper had an annex built at 229 West 43rd Street.[59] After several expansions, the 43rd Street building became the newspaper's main headquarters in 1960 and the Times Tower on Broadway was sold the following year.[60] It served as the newspaper's main printing plant until 1997, when the newspaper opened a state-of-the-art printing plant in the College Point section of the borough of Queens.[61]","A decade later, The New York Times moved its newsroom and businesses headquarters from West 43rd Street to a new tower at 620 Eighth Avenue between West 40th and 41st Streets, in Manhattan –  directly across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The new headquarters for the newspaper, known officially as The New York Times Building but unofficially called the new ""Times Tower"" by many New Yorkers, is a skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano.[62][63]","The paper's involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key United States Supreme Court decisions supporting freedom of the press, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. In it, the United States Supreme Court established the ""actual malice"" standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. Because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff, and difficulty in proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.[64]","In 1971, the Pentagon Papers, a secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States' political and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given (""leaked"") to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. The New York Times began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions taken by U.S. Marines well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.[65]","When The New York Times began publishing its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His words to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included ""People have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing..."" and ""Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail.""[66] After failing to get The New York Times to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that The New York Times cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, The Washington Post began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian, a Post editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the Post received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, William Rehnquist, asking them to stop publishing. When the Post refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into New York Times Co. v. United States 403 US 713. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake.[65]","Discriminatory practices restricting women in editorial positions were previously used by the paper. The newspaper's first general woman reporter was Jane Grant, who described her experience afterwards. She wrote, ""In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired"". Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable hazing. Because of her gender, promotions were out of the question, according to the then-managing editor. She was there for fifteen years, interrupted by World War I.[67]","In 1935, Anne McCormick wrote to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, ""I hope you won't expect me to revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff.""[68] Later, she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues did. Even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did.[69] Clifton Daniel said, ""[After World War II,] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment.""[70] Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still were not allowed to ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work.[71] Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment.[72] Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said, ""'It will come as a surprise to you, perhaps, that the reporter is a girl,' he began... [G]asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'""[73] The New York Times hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the Chicago Tribune, where ""[s]he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs.""[74]","The New York Times published on December 20, 2012, an interactive storytelling in longform multimedia, Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek by reporter John Branch about the 2012 Tunnel Creek avalanche. The six-part story, which integrated video, photos, and graphics, was hailed as a watershed moment for the journalism industry.[75][76] The feature was awarded a Peabody Award, which called the piece a ""spectacular example of the potential of digital-age storytelling"" which ""combines thorough traditional reporting of a deadly avalanche with stunning topographic video.""[77] Snow Fall inspired the Times to appoint Sam Sifton ""Snowfaller in Chief,"" expanding multimedia narratives in the newsroom in the tradition of Snow Fall.[78]","In February 2013, the paper stopped offering lifelong positions for its journalists and editors.[79]","In 1896, Adolph Ochs bought The New York Times, a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned The New York Times ever since.[34] The publisher went public on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American Stock Exchange.[80] After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B voting shares. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.","The Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company's class B shares. Any alteration to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The Trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick, Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr. and Cathy J. Sulzberger.[81]","Turner Catledge, the top editor at The New York Times from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.[82]","On January 20, 2009, The New York Times reported that its parent company, The New York Times Company, had reached an agreement to borrow $250 million from Carlos Slim, a Mexican businessman and the world's second richest person,[83] ""to help the newspaper company finance its businesses"".[84] The New York Times Company later repaid that loan ahead of schedule.[85] Since then, Slim has bought large quantities of the company's Class A shares, which are available for purchase by the public and offer less control over the company than Class B shares, which are privately held.[85] Slim's investments in the company included large purchases of Class A shares in 2011, when he increased his stake in the company to 8.1% of Class A shares,[86] and again in 2015, when he exercised stock options—acquired as part of a repayment plan on the 2009 loan—to purchase 15.9 million Class A shares.[85] As of March 7, 2016, Slim owned 17.4% of the company's Class A shares, according to annual filings submitted by the company.[87][88]","Although Slim is the largest shareholder in the company, his investment does not give him the ability to control the newspaper, as his stake allows him to vote only for Class A directors, who compose just a third of the company's board.[85] According to the company's 2016 annual filings, Slim did not own any of the company's Class B shares.[87]","Dual-class structures caught on in the mid-20th century as families such as the Grahams of The Washington Post Company sought to gain access to public capital without losing control. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, had a similar structure and was controlled by the Bancroft family but was later bought by News Corporation in 2007, which itself is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his family through a similar dual-class structure.[89]","The newspaper is organized in three sections, including the magazine.","Some sections, such as Metro, are only found in the editions of the paper distributed in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-State Area and not in the national or Washington, D.C. editions.[90] Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section.[91] In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times' announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.[14] According to Russ Stanton, editor of the Los Angeles Times, a competitor, the newsroom of The New York Times is twice the size of the Los Angeles Times, which has a newsroom of 600.[92] In March 2014, Vanessa Friedman was named the ""fashion director and chief fashion critic"" of The New York Times.[93]","When referring to people, The New York Times generally uses honorifics, rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, Book Review and Magazine).[94] It stayed with an eight-column format until September 7, 1976, years after other papers had switched to six,[20] and it was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, with the first color photograph on the front page appearing on October 16, 1997.[21] In the absence of a major headline, the day's most important story generally appears in the top-right column, on the main page. The typefaces used for the headlines are custom variations of Cheltenham. The running text is set at 8.7 point Imperial.[95][96]","Joining a roster of other major American newspapers in the last ten years, including USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, The New York Times announced on July 18, 2006, that it would be narrowing the width of its paper by six inches. In an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses for most print versions of American newspapers, the move, which would result in a five percent reduction in news coverage, would have a target savings of $12 million a year for the paper.[97] The change from the traditional 54 inches (1.4 m) broadsheet style to a more compact 48-inch web width (12-inch page width) was addressed by both Executive Editor Bill Keller and The New York Times President Scott Heekin-Canedy in memos to the staff. Keller defended the ""more reader-friendly"" move indicating that in cutting out the ""flabby or redundant prose in longer pieces"" the reduction would make for a better paper. Similarly, Keller confronted the challenges of covering news with ""less room"" by proposing more ""rigorous editing"" and promised an ongoing commitment to ""hard-hitting, ground-breaking journalism"".[98] The official change went into effect on August 6, 2007.[99]","The New York Times printed a display advertisement on its first page on January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper.[100] The advertisement, for CBS, was in color and ran the entire width of the page.[101] The newspaper promised it would place first-page advertisements on only the lower half of the page.[100]","In August 2014, The Times decided to use the word ""torture"" to describe incidents in which interrogators ""inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information."" This was a shift from the paper's previous practice of describe such practices as ""harsh"" or ""brutal"" interrogations.[102]","The paper maintains a strict profanity policy. A 2007 review of a concert by punk band Fucked Up, for example, completely avoided mention of the group's name.[103] However, the Times has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value.[104] During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the Times did print the words ""fuck"" and ""pussy,"" among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording. Times politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: ""It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length,"" ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because ""[t]o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given that we would be running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said.""[105]","The New York Times has won 122 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper. The prize is awarded for excellence in journalism in a range of categories.[5]","It has also won three Peabody Awards (and jointly received two). A Peabody award was given in 2003 for the documentary Frontline: A Dangerous Business, a joint investigation by the New York Times, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and WGBH's Frontline about the conditions faced by workers at McWayne Inc.[106] The newspaper won another Peabody award (in 1951) for the New York Times Youth Forum (which featured ""unrehearsed discussion by students selected from private, public and parochial schools, on topics ranging from the political, educational and scientific to the international and the United Nations."")[107] Again in 2008, the newspaper won another reward for ""Aggressively and creatively adding sound and moving images to its traditional package of news and features, The New York Times has stepped forward as an innovator in online journalism. Its website exemplifies a new age for the press, expanding its role in ways unimaginable only a few years ago.""[108] In 2013, the Times, along with The National Film Board of Canada won a Peabody Award for the documentary ""A Short History of the Highrise"".[109] A personal award was also given to then chief media critic Jack Gould in 1956.[110]","The New York Times began publishing daily on the World Wide Web on January 22, 1996, ""offering readers around the world immediate access to most of the daily newspaper's contents.""[111] Since its online launch, the newspaper has consistently been ranked one of the top websites. Accessing some articles requires registration, though this could be bypassed in some cases through Times RSS feeds.[112] The website had 555 million pageviews in March 2005.[113] The domain nytimes.com attracted at least 146 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study. The New York Times Web site ranks 59th by number of unique visitors, with over 20 million unique visitors in March 2009 making it the most visited newspaper site with more than twice the number of unique visitors as the next most popular site.[114] as of May 2009[update], nytimes.com produced 22 of the 50 most popular newspaper blogs.[115] NYTimes.com is ranked 129 in the world, and 27 in the U.S. by Alexa (as of March 12, 2017).[116]","In September 2005, the paper decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns in a program known as TimesSelect, which encompassed many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, TimesSelect cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year,[117] though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty.[118][119] To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material,[120] and at least one site once compiled links of reprinted material.[121] On September 17, 2007, The New York Times announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site.[122] In addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, The New York Times news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge, as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain.[123][124] Access to the Premium Crosswords section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for $6.95 per month or $39.95 per year. Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized TimesSelect,[125][126] with Friedman going so far as to say ""I hate it. It pains me enormously because it's cut me off from a lot, a lot of people, especially because I have a lot of people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience.""[127]","The New York Times was made available on the iPhone and iPod Touch in 2008,[128] and on the iPad mobile devices in 2010.[129] It was also the first newspaper to offer a video game as part of its editorial content, Food Import Folly by Persuasive Games.[130] In 2010, The New York Times editors collaborated with students and faculty from New York University's Studio 20 Journalism Masters program to launch and produce ""The Local East Village"", a hyperlocal blog designed to offer news ""by, for and about the residents of the East Village"".[131] That same year, reCAPTCHA helped to digitize old editions of The New York Times.[132]","In 2012, The New York Times introduced a Chinese-language news site, cn.nytimes.com, with content created by staff based in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, though the server was placed outside of China to avoid censorship issues.[133] In March 2013, The New York Times and National Film Board of Canada announced a partnership entitled A Short History of the Highrise, which will create four short documentaries for the Internet about life in highrise buildings as part of the NFB's Highrise project, utilizing images from the newspaper's photo archives for the first three films, and user-submitted images for the final film.[134] The third project in the series, ""A Short History of the Highrise"", won a Peabody Award in 2013.[135]","Falling print advertising revenue and projections of continued decline resulted in a paywall being instituted in 2011, regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100 million in revenue as of March 2012[update].[136] The paywall was announced on March 17, 2011, that starting on March 28, 2011 (March 17, 2011, for Canada), it would charge frequent readers for access to its online content.[137] Readers would be able to access up to 20 articles each month without charge. (Although beginning in April 2012, the number of free-access articles was halved to just ten articles per month.) Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription. This plan would allow free access for occasional readers, but produce revenue from ""heavy"" readers. Digital subscriptions rates for four weeks range from $15 to $35 depending on the package selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99¢. Subscribers to the paper's print edition get full access without any additional fee. Some content, such as the front page and section fronts will remain free, as well as the Top News page on mobile apps.[138] In January 2013, The New York Times' Public Editor Margaret M. Sullivan announced that for the first time in many decades, the paper generated more revenue through subscriptions than through advertising.[139]","The newspaper's website was hacked on August 29, 2013, by the Syrian Electronic Army, a hacking group that supports the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The SEA managed to penetrate the paper's domain name registrar, Melbourne IT, and alter DNS records for The New York Times, putting some of its websites out of service for hours.[140]","The food section is supplemented on the web by properties for home cooks and for out-of-home dining. New York Times Cooking (cooking.nytimes.com; also available via iOS app) provides access to more than 17,000 recipes on file as of November 2016,[141] and availability of saving recipes from other sites around the web. The newspaper's restaurant search (nytimes.com/reviews/dining) allows online readers to search NYC area restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, price, and reviewer rating. The New York Times has also published several cookbooks, including The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century, published in late 2010.","The Times Reader is a digital version of The New York Times. It was created via a collaboration between the newspaper and Microsoft. Times Reader takes the principles of print journalism and applies them to the technique of online reporting. Times Reader uses a series of technologies developed by Microsoft and their Windows Presentation Foundation team. It was announced in Seattle in April 2006, by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., Bill Gates, and Tom Bodkin.[142] In 2009, the Times Reader 2.0 was rewritten in Adobe AIR.[143] In December 2013, the newspaper announced that the Times Reader app would be discontinued on January 6, 2014, urging readers of the app to instead begin using the subscription-only ""Today's Paper"" app.[144]","In 2008, The New York Times created an app for the iPhone and iPod touch which allowed users to download articles to their mobile device enabling them to read the paper even when they were unable to receive a signal.[145] In April 2010, The New York Times announced it would begin publishing daily content through an iPad app.[146] As of October 2010[update], The New York Times iPad app is ad-supported and available for free without a paid subscription, but translated into a subscription-based model in 2011.[129]","In 2010, the newspaper also launched an App for Android smartphones, followed later by an App for Windows phones.[147]","The New York Times began producing podcasts in 2006. Among the early podcasts were Inside The Times and Inside The New York Times Book Review. Several of the Times podcasts were cancelled in 2012.[148][149] The Times returned to launching new podcasts in 2016, including Modern Love with WBUR.[150] On January 30, 2017, The New York Times launched a new podcast The Daily.[151][152]","In June 2012, The New York Times launched its first official foreign-language variant, cn.nytimes.com, in Chinese,[153] viewable in both traditional and simplified Chinese characters. The project was led by Craig S. Smith on the business side and Philip P. Pan on the editorial side.","The site's initial success was interrupted in October that year following the publication of an investigative article[b] by David Barboza about the finances of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's family.[154] In retaliation for the article, the Chinese government blocked access to both nytimes.com and cn.nytimes.com inside the People's Republic of China (PRC).","Despite Chinese government interference, however, the Chinese-language operations have continued to develop, adding a second site, cn.nytstyle.com, iOS and Android apps and newsletters, all of which are accessible inside the PRC. The China operations also produce three print publications in Chinese. Traffic to cn.nytimes.com, meanwhile, has risen due to the widespread use of VPN technology in the PRC and to a growing Chinese audience outside mainland China.[155] New York Times articles are also available to users in China via the use of mirror websites, apps, domestic newspapers, and social media.[155][156] The Chinese platforms now represent one of The New York Times' top five digital markets globally. The editor-in-chief of the Chinese platforms is Ching-Ching Ni.[157]","The website's ""Newsroom Navigator"" collects online resources for use by reporters and editors. It is maintained by Rich Meislin.[158][159][160] Further specific collections are available to cover the subjects of business, politics and health.[158][161][162] In 1998, Meislin was editor-in-chief of electronic media at the newspaper.[163]","Because of holidays, no editions were printed on November 23, 1851; January 2, 1852; July 4, 1852; January 2, 1853; and January 1, 1854.[164]","Because of strikes, the regular edition of The New York Times was not printed during the following periods:[165]","The New York Times editorial page is often regarded as liberal.[168][169] In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public editor (ombudsman), Daniel Okrent, wrote that ""the Op-Ed page editors do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from outsiders they publish – but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists, only two of whom could be classified as conservative (and, even then, of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and, in the case of William Safire, opposes some central provisions of the Patriot Act.""[170]","The New York Times has not endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956; since 1960, it has endorsed the Democratic nominee in every presidential election (see New York Times presidential endorsements).[171] However, the Times did endorse incumbent Republican Mayors of New York City Rudy Giuliani in 1997[172] and Michael Bloomberg in 2005[173] and 2009.[174] The Times also endorsed Republican Governor George Pataki in 2002.[175]","The New York Times supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[176] On May 26, 2004, a year after the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change.[177] Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized.[178][179] One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.[180][181]","A 2015 study found that The New York Times fed into an overarching tendency towards national bias. During the Iranian nuclear crisis the newspaper minimized the ""negative processes"" of the United States while overemphasizing similar processes of Iran. This tendency was shared by other papers such as The Guardian, Tehran Times, and the Fars News Agency, while Xinhua News Agency was found to be more neutral while at the same time mimicking the foreign policy of the Peoples' Republic of China.[182]","A 2003 study in The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics concluded that The New York Times reporting was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians.[183] A 2002 study published in the journal Journalism examined Middle East coverage of the Second Intifada over a one-month period in the Times, Washington Post and Chicago Tribune. The study authors said that the Times was ""the most slanted in a pro-Israeli direction"" with a bias ""reflected ... in its use of headlines, photographs, graphics, sourcing practices and lead paragraphs.""[184]","For its coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel.[185][186] The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel.[187] On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.[188]","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity. A piece in which Thomas Friedman commented that praise awarded to Netanyahu during a speech at congress was ""paid for by the Israel lobby"" elicited an apology and clarification from its writer.[189]","The New York Times' public editor Clark Hoyt concluded in his January 10, 2009, column, ""Though the most vociferous supporters of Israel and the Palestinians do not agree, I think The New York Times, largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war, has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and complete job — and has largely succeeded.""[190]","On November 14, 2001, in The New York Times' 150th anniversary issue, former executive editor Max Frankel wrote that before and during World War II, the NY Times had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on the Holocaust in their news pages.[191] Laurel Leff, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the Third Reich targeting of Jews for genocide. Her 2005 book Buried by the Times documents the paper's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspaper's Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, concerning Jewishness, antisemitism, and Zionism.[192]","During the war, The New York Times journalist William L. Laurence was ""on the payroll of the War Department"".[193][194]","The New York Times was criticized for the work of reporter Walter Duranty, who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936. Duranty wrote a series of stories in 1931 on the Soviet Union and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time; however, he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, most particularly the Ukrainian famine in the 1930s.[195][196][197][198] In 2003, after the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry, the Times hired Mark von Hagen, professor of Russian history at Columbia University, to review Duranty's work. Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to Stalinist propaganda. In comments to the press he stated, ""For the sake of The New York Times' honor, they should take the prize away.""[199]","In the mid to late 1950s, ""fashion writer[s]... were required to come up every month with articles whose total column-inches reflected the relative advertising strength of every [""department"" or ""specialty""] store [""assigned"" to a writer]...

"" However, within this requirement, story ideas may have been the reporters' and editors' own.[200]","In May 2003, The New York Times reporter Jayson Blair was forced to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in The New York Times' initial reluctance to fire him.[201]","The newspaper was criticized for largely reporting the prosecutors' version of events in the 2006 Duke lacrosse case.[202][203] Suzanne Smalley of Newsweek criticized the newspaper for its ""credulous""[204] coverage of the charges of rape against Duke University lacrosse players. Stuart Taylor, Jr. and KC Johnson, in their book Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case, write: ""at the head of the guilt-presuming pack, The New York Times vied in a race to the journalistic bottom with trash-TV talk shows.""[203]","In February 2009, a Village Voice music blogger accused the newspaper of using ""chintzy, ad-hominem allegations"" in an article on British Tamil music artist M.I.A. concerning her activism against the Sinhala-Tamil conflict in Sri Lanka.[205][206] M.I.A. criticized the paper in January 2010 after a travel piece rated post-conflict Sri Lanka the ""#1 place to go in 2010"".[207][208] In June 2010, The New York Times Magazine published a correction on its cover article of M.I.A., acknowledging that the interview conducted by current W editor and then-Times Magazine contributor Lynn Hirschberg contained a recontextualization of two quotes.[209][210] In response to the piece, M.I.A. broadcast Hirschberg's phone number and secret audio recordings from the interview via her Twitter and website.[211][212]","The New York Times was criticized for the 13-month delay of the December 2005 story revealing the U.S. National Security Agency warrantless surveillance program.[213] Ex-NSA officials blew the whistle on the program to journalists James Risen and Eric Lichtblau, who presented an investigative article to the newspaper in November 2004, weeks before America's presidential election. Contact with former agency officials began the previous summer.[214]","Former The New York Times executive editor Bill Keller decided not to report the piece after being pressured by the Bush administration and being advised not to do so by New York Times Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman. Keller explained the silence's rationale in an interview with the newspaper in 2013, stating ""Three years after 9/11, we, as a country, were still under the influence of that trauma, and we, as a newspaper, were not immune"".[215]","In 2014, PBS Frontline interviewed Risen and Lichtblau, who said that the newspaper's plan was to not publish the story at all. ""The editors were furious at me"", Risen said to the program. ""They thought I was being insubordinate."" Risen wrote a book about the mass surveillance revelations after The New York Times declined the piece's publication, and only released it after Risen told them that he would publish the book. Another reporter told NPR that the newspaper ""avoided disaster"" by ultimately publishing the story.[216]","In September 2014, around the time when India's Mars Orbiter Mission probe was to go into Mars orbit, the International New York Times published an editorial cartoon by Singapore cartoonist Heng Kim Song depicting a turban-wearing man with a cow knocking at the door of the ""Elite Space Club"" with members inside reading a newspaper with a headline about India's Mars mission.[217][218]","The cartoon drew criticism, with critics saying that the cartoon was racist.[219][220][221] Times editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal, apologized, writing in a Facebook post: ""A large number of readers have complained about a recent editorial cartoon in The International New York Times, about India's foray into space exploration. The intent of the cartoonist ... was to highlight how space exploration is no longer the exclusive domain of rich, Western countries. Mr. Heng, who is based in Singapore, uses images and text – often in a provocative way – to make observations about international affairs. We apologize to readers who were offended by the choice of images in this cartoon. Mr. Heng was in no way trying to impugn India, its government or its citizens.""[222][218]","On June 16, 2015, The New York Times published an article reporting the deaths of six Irish students staying in Berkeley, California when the balcony they were standing on collapsed, the paper's story insinuating that they were to blame for the collapse. The paper stated that the behavior of Irish students coming to the US on J1 visas was an ""embarrassment to Ireland"".[223] The Irish Taoiseach and former President of Ireland criticized the newspaper for ""being insensitive and inaccurate"" in its handling of the story.[224]","In May 2015, a New York Times exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on the working conditions of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere[225] and the health hazards to which they are exposed[226] attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo.[227] In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, in the New York Review of Books. Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story.[228] The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy.[229] The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound.[230]","In September and October 2015, nail salon owners and workers protested at The New York Times offices several times, in response to the story and the ensuing New York State crackdown.[231][232] In October 2015, Reason magazine published a three part re-reporting of the story by Jim Epstein, charging that the series was filled with misquotes and factual errors respecting both its claims of illegally low wages and health hazards. Epstein additionally argued that The New York Times had mistranslated the ads cited in its answer to Bernstein, and that those ads actually validated Bernstein's argument.[233][234][235] In November 2015, The New York Times' public editor concluded that the exposé's ""findings, and the language used to express them, should have been dialed back — in some instances substantially"" and recommended that ""The Times write further follow-up stories, including some that re-examine its original findings and that take on the criticism from salon owners and others — not defensively but with an open mind.""[236]","In April 2016, two black female employees in their sixties filed a federal class action lawsuit against The New York Times Company CEO Mark Thompson and chief revenue officer Meredith Levien, claiming age, gender, and racial discrimination. The plaintiffs claim that the Times advertising department favored younger white employees over older black employees in making firing and promotion decisions.[237][238] The Times said that the suit was ""entirely without merit"" and was ""a series of recycled, scurrilous and unjustified attacks.""[238]","New York Times public editor (ombudsman) Liz Spayd wrote in 2016 that ""Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview"" and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim, but did opine that the Times is ""part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources.""[239] Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: ""We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times. I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No.""[239]","Times public editor Arthur Brisbane wrote in 2012: ""When The Times covers a national presidential campaign, I have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so. Across the paper's many departments, though, so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism — for lack of a better term — that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times.""[240]","In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public editor Daniel Okrent, wrote an opinion piece in which he said that The New York Times did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. He stated that this bias reflected the paper's cosmopolitanism, which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City.[170] He wrote, ""if you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can make you feel you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world.""[170] Okrent wrote that the Time's Arts & Leisure, Sunday Times Magazine, and Culture coverage trend to the left.[241]","In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles study by former fellows of a conservative think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the study after The Wall Street Journal (85.1).[242] The validity of the study has been questioned, however. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan, cited flaws in the study's methodology.[243][244]","Donald Trump has frequently criticized the New York Times on his Twitter account before and during his presidency; since November 2015, Trump has referred to the Times as ""the failing New York Times"" in a series of tweets.[245] New York Times editor Mark Thompson noted that the paper had enjoyed soaring digital readership, with the fourth quarter of 2016 seeing the highest number of new digital subscribers to the newspaper since 2011.[246][247][248]","Critic Matt Taibbi accused The New York Times of favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the paper's news coverage of the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries.[249] Responding to the complaints of many readers, New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that, ""The Times has not ignored Mr. Sanders's campaign, but it hasn't always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say.""[250] Times senior editor Carolyn Ryan defended both the volume of New York Times coverage (noting that Sanders had received about the same amount of article coverage as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio) and its tone.[251]","The Times has developed a national and international ""reputation for thoroughness"" over time.[252] Among journalists, the paper is held in high regard; a 1999 survey of newspaper editors conducted by the Columbia Journalism Review found that the Times was the ""best"" American paper, ahead of the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and Los Angeles Times.[253] The Times also was ranked #1 in a 2011 ""quality"" ranking of U.S. newspapers by Daniel de Vise of the Washington Post; the objective ranking took into account the number of recent Pulitzer Prizes won, circulation, and perceived Web site quality.[253] A 2012 report in WNYC called the Times ""the most respected newspaper in the world.""[254]","Nevertheless, like many other U.S. media sources, the Times had suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. from 2004 to 2012.[255] A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations. Among respondents who gave a rating, 49% said that the believed ""all or most"" of the Times's reporting, while 50% disagreed. A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The Times's score was comparable to that of USA Today.[255] Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC's On the Media writing for the New York Times says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that ""Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation.""[256]",The TimesMachine is a web-based archive of scanned issues of The New York Times from 1851 through 2002.[257],"Unlike The New York Times online archive, the TimesMachine presents scanned images of the actual newspaper.

LeBron_James,"LeBron Raymone James (/ləˈbrɒn/; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). James has won three NBA championships (2012, 2013, 2016), four NBA Most Valuable Player Awards (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013), three NBA Finals MVP Awards (2012, 2013, 2016), two Olympic gold medals (2008, 2012), an NBA scoring title (2008), and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award (2004). He has also been selected to 13 NBA All-Star teams, 12 All-NBA teams, and six All-Defensive teams, and is the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer.","James played high school basketball at St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. James led Cleveland to the franchise's first Finals appearance in 2007, but ultimately lost to the San Antonio Spurs. In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in a highly publicized ESPN special titled The Decision. James famously combined with NBA All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to form what was known as the big three in Miami. He spent four seasons with the Heat, reaching the Finals all four years and winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, he led Miami on a 27-game winning streak, the third longest in league history. After losing to the Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In Cleveland, James partnered with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and immediately advanced to two consecutive Finals against the Golden State Warriors, winning the championship in 2016 to end Cleveland's fifty-two year professional sports title drought.","Off the court, James has accumulated considerable wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America's most influential and popular athletes. He has been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials. He also hosted the ESPY Awards, Saturday Night Live, and appeared in the 2015 film Trainwreck.",,,"James was born on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised James on her own.[1][2]:22 Growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[3] Realizing that he would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed James to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[2]:23","As a youth, James played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[3] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[2]:24 The players were inseparable and dubbed themselves the ""Fab Four"", promising each other that they would attend high school together.[2]:27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a predominately white private Catholic school.[4][5]","As a freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent-St. Mary varsity basketball team.[6] The Fighting Irish finished the year 27–0, winning the Division III state title.[6] As a sophomore, he averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.[7] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, and college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[2]:51[8] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[6] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio's Mr. Basketball and was selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[9]","Prior to the start of James's junior year, he appeared in SLAM Magazine and was lauded as possibly ""the best high school basketball player in America right now.""[10] During the season, he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[2]:104 With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game,[6] he was again named Ohio's Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[6] and became the first junior to win the boys' basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year Award.[2]:117 St. Vincent-St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[2]:114 Following the loss, James seriously considered declaring for the 2002 NBA draft, unsuccessfully petitioning for an adjustment to the NBA's draft eligibility rules that required prospective players to have at least graduated from high school.[11] During this time, James used marijuana to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[12][13][14]","During his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[2]:142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season.[2]:143 For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,[9] was named Ohio's Mr. Basketball and USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[2]:178[6] and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[6] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the 2003 McDonald's All-American Game—losing his NCAA eligibility and making it official he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[15] According to writer Ryan Jones, James left high school as ""the most hyped basketball player ever"".[2]:142","Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a professional athlete.[16] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing, because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[15] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[15] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[17] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[18]","James played wide receiver for St. Vincent-St. Mary's football team in high school and was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[2]:51[19] As a sophomore, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he led the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[7] His football career came to an end before his senior year when he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game.[20] Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on whether he could have played in the National Football League.[2]:91[21][22][23][24]","James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[25] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[26] At the conclusion of the season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year, finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game.[27] He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and just the third player in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game in his rookie year.[28] The Cavaliers finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[29]","James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection in 2004–05, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[30] On March 20, he scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single game points record.[31] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team at the end of the season.[7] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[31] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season at 42–40.[32]","At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[33] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[34] he finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[35] Under James's leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[36] In his postseason debut, he recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards.[37] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, making another in Game 5.[38] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[39][40]","In 2006–07, James's averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[7] Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, stemming from a lack of effort and focus.[43] The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed.[44][45] In Game 5 of the Conference Finals, James notched 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning lay-up with two seconds left, against the Pistons.[46] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance ""one of the greatest moments in postseason history"" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as ""Jordan-esque"".[47] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[48] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship.[49] They advanced to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[50] For the Finals, James averaged 22 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game.[27]","In February of the 2007–08 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, 8-rebound, and 9-assist performance.[51][52] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty.[53] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, representing his first scoring title.[54] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[55] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the Boston Celtics in the next round.[56] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a ""shootout"".[57]","At the conclusion of the 2008–09 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[59][60] He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[61] Behind his play, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[62] With averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, he became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[63]","In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a match-up with the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals.[64] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[48] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1.[65] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, an act many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[66][67] For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game,[68] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[34]","Midway through the 2009–10 season, the Cavaliers' guards experienced significant injuries, forcing James into a temporary point guard role.[69] With increased minutes as the team's primary ball handler, he averaged 8.6 assists in addition to 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting, culminating in a second consecutive MVP Award.[70] Cleveland also finished the season with the league's best record for the second straight year.[71] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Bulls in the first round but lost to the Celtics in the second round.[72] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[73] At the conclusion of the game, he walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd, the team having just suffered their worst home playoff loss ever.[74] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James recording 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and nine turnovers in a losing effort.[72]","James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 am EDT on July 1, 2010.[76] During his free agency, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[77] On July 8, he announced that he would sign with the Heat on a live ESPN special titled The Decision.[78] The telecast, broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut, raised $2.5 million for the charity and an additional $3.5 million from advertisement revenue that was donated to other charities.[79][80] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami;[81][82] reports later arose that the trio had discussed their 2010 free agencies together in 2006.[83] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the load offensively, thinking that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning a championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[84][85] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[86] Relieved of the burden of scoring, James thought he could be the first player to average a triple-double in a season since Oscar Robertson.[84]","James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players for leaving the Cavaliers. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[87] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[88] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[89] Former NBA players including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as ""the guy"".[90][91][92] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[93][94] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, a radical change from years prior.[95][96] The phrase ""taking my talents to South Beach"" became a punch line for critics.[97][98]","Immediately following The Decision, James claimed that there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism.[99] During the 2010–11 season, he expressed some regret, saying: ""[I] probably would do it a little bit different ... But I'm happy with my decision.""[100] Before the 2011–12 season, he again relented about the special: ""... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it.""[96]","James officially became a member of the Heat on July 10, 2010.[101] With the move, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[102] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new ""big three"" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[103] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[104][105] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[106][107]","Throughout the 2010–11 season, James embraced the villain role that was bestowed upon him by the media; he later admitted that he regretted this approach.[108] On December 2, he faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent, scoring 38 points and leading Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball.[109][110] He finished the season with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[34] Entering the playoffs as the East's second seed, Miami advanced to the Finals before stumbling against the Dallas Mavericks, losing in six games despite holding a 2–1 series lead going into Game 4.[111] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series.[112] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[113]","Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, James spent the offseason working with Hakeem Olajuwon on his post game.[114][115] His work with Olajuwon paid off, fueling what Grantland's Kirk Goldsberry called ""one of the greatest and most important transformations in recent sports history"".[116] Behind James' more post-oriented play,[116] Miami matched their best start to a season in franchise history,[117] and at the conclusion of the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, he was named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[118]","In Game 4 of the second round of the playoffs, James registered 40 points, 18 rebounds, and 9 assists to help even the series against the Indiana Pacers.[120] Miami eventually defeated the Pacers in six games.[121] Facing elimination in Game 6 of the Conference Finals against the Celtics, James scored 45 points to lead the Heat to victory in what the New York Times called a ""career-defining performance"".[122] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder.[121] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[123] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[124] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[125]","In February of the 2012–13 season, James' performance was described by Sports Illustrated as a ""month for the ages"",[126] averaging 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[127][128][129] During this period, the Heat began a 27-game winning streak, the third longest in NBA history.[130] Behind his play, Miami finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record,[131] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[132] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[34]","In Game 1 of the Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[133] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his responsibilities to those of his ""Cleveland days"".[134] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the Spurs,[135] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[136] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3.[68][135][137] In Game 6, he recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[138] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[139] He was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[140]","On March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[141] Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[142] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[34] In the second round of the playoffs, he tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[143] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[144] In Game 1 of the Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the Spurs take an early series lead.[145] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[146] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[147] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2 steals per game.[148]","On June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, officially becoming an unrestricted free agent on July 1.[151] On July 11, he revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[152] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[153][154][155] On July 12, he officially signed with the team,[156] who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[157] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[158]","In January of the 2014–15 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[159] In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[34] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Bulls.[160] In the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[161] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[161] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before being eliminated in six games.[162] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[163] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round.[162]","During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' head coach David Blatt.[164][165] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[166] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[34] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors,[166] who were coming off a record-setting 73 win season.[167] To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[168] James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[169] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala in the final two minutes,[170][171][172] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[173] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[174] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[168] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[175]","The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[176] James later described it as one of the ""strangest"" years of his career.[177] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too ""top heavy"", for which he received criticism.[178] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[34] In Game 3 of the first round of the postseason, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in playoff history.[179]","James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[180] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[181][182] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[180] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding professionals to their line-up.[180][183] James felt his limited playing time was a ""lowlight"" and believed he was not given ""a fair opportunity to play"".[184] His attitude during the Olympics was described as ""disrespectful"" and ""distasteful"" by columnists Adrian Wojnarowski and Peter Vecsey, respectively.[185][186]","At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[187][188] The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal.[187] James' behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[185][189]","Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[185][190] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[191][192] Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[180] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: ""I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.""[182] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[193] In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.[193]","James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[194][195] He became the leader of the team with Kobe Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[196][197][198] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[199][200][201][202] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.[a][202] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[204] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[180][204] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[205] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said James ""is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.""[206]","Standing 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) and weighing 250 pounds (113.4 kg), James has started at small forward and power forward, but he can also play the other three positions.[207] With career averages of 27.1 points, 7.3 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game,[34] he is considered one of the most athletic and versatile players in the NBA,[116][208][209] and has been compared to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[27][210] Since 2011, he has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[b][c]","Many basketball analysts, coaches, fans, and current and former players consider James to be one of the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall.[d] He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[34] With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span.[228] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[60][229] James has appeared in the Finals seven times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that his supporting casts were usually poor and, despite the fact that James had played well, his team was defeated by superior competition.[230][231][232]","Upon entering the NBA, James made an immediate offensive impact, leading the Cavaliers in scoring as a 19-year-old rookie.[234][235] He holds numerous ""youngest to"" distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 28,000 points during his career.[e] During his first stint in Cleveland, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[116] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball, leading the NBA in three-point plays in 2006.[240] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams as he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[241] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for a basket.[242] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having developed a reliable jump shot or post game.[243] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously utilized by Greg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[244]","In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[116] James began spending more time in the post and shooting fewer three-pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012.[34][116] He improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots, finishing second in the league in catch-and-shoot field goal percentage in 2013.[245] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's ""pass-happy"" offense.[246] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels,[247] peaking in 2014 when he registered a 64.9 true shooting percentage.[34] During this period, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James' free throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as ""average"".[248] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[249] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[34][250] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the worst high-volume outside shooter from outside the paint in the NBA.[251] Despite these changes, he has remained an elite offensive player who is capable of beating defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[241]","James' playmaking ability is generally considered to be one of his premier skills, with some analysts ranking him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[252] He is the only frontcourt player in league history to register over 7,000 career assists.[253] Using his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses to his advantage,[254] James is able to create easy points for his teammates with accurate assists, manufacturing a league leading 2.6 three-pointers per game by way of his passing alone in 2013.[255] He will often execute passes that would normally be considered unconventional, including passes after leaving his feet and passes through defensive traffic.[256] His uncanny tendency to find the open man played a significant role in the evolution of modern NBA defenses, forcing teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[241]","Early in James' career, he was criticized by the media for his play in pressure situations; specifically, for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games.[257][258] In a 2011 interview, teammate Chris Bosh stated that he would rather have Dwyane Wade take a last-second shot than James.[259] Later in James' career, his clutch play was viewed more favorably; for example, a 2011 article by Henry Abbott revealed that James had a better shooting percentage with the game on the line than such notables as Ray Allen and Kobe Bryant.[260] In 2015, FiveThirtyEight wrote that he might be ""the most clutch playoff shooter of his generation"".[261]","At the beginning of James' career, he was considered a poor defensive player,[262] but he improved steadily through the years. Near the end of his first tenure in Cleveland, he became proficient at the chase-down block; coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block their shot.[59] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defender, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[263] Paired with teammates Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[264] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[265] Beginning in 2014, some analysts noted a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[266][267] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as ""chill mode"".[268] Writing for ESPN in 2016, Nate Duncan observed that while James tended to take off more plays than in his younger days, he was able to raise his level in that year's Finals and temporarily recapture his Miami form.[269]","James proposed to Savannah Brinson, his high school sweetheart, on December 31, 2011 at a party celebrating New Year's Eve and his 27th birthday.[270] The two were married on September 14, 2013 in San Diego.[271] Together, they have three children: LeBron James Jr. (b. 2004),[272] Bryce Maximus James (b. 2007),[273] and Zhuri James (b. 2014).[274] During his tenure with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, an affluent Miami neighborhood, where he bought a three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay for $9 million.[275] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-feet East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles for about $21 million.[276]","James is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[277] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[278] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James' marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[279][280]","Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his playing contracts, usually opting to sign shorter term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility.[281][101][282] For example, in 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[283] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign with the Heat together.[284] During his second stint in Cleveland, he began opting out and re-signing on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[156][285][286][287] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[288] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[289]","James has numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies he does business with are Audemars Piguet,[290] Coca-Cola,[291] Dunkin' Brands,[292] McDonald's,[293] Nike,[291] State Farm,[294] and Samsung.[291] Coming out of high school, he was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[295] eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million.[296] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[297] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool FC,[298] who he has claimed his support for.[299] As a result of James' endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[300] In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[301] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[302] In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[303] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[304] James has stated that we would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[305]","James, with comedian Jimmy Kimmel, co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[306] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[307] He has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[308] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[309] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[310] That same year, James' digital video company, Uninterrupted, raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.[311]","Along with business partner Maverick Carter, James owns production company SpringHill Entertainment,[312] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, released in 2009 and chronicling James' high school years.[313] Series produced by SpringHill include the Disney XD sports documentaries Becoming,[314] Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[315] and animated web series The LeBrons.[316] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[317]","James is considered by many, including his fellow players, to be the ""face of the NBA"".[318] His opinions have yielded significant influence on important league decisions; for example, in 2014 he asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[319] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first Vice President of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[320]","Throughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes.[321][322] During his first tenure with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with Sherwin-Williams displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[323] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended Cleveland Indians games against the New York Yankees sporting a Yankees hat.[324] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision, he was listed as one of the world's most disliked athletes.[325][326] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[327] In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[328] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[329]","James is a philanthropist who is an active supporter of the Boys & Girls Club of America, Children's Defense Fund, and ONEXONE.[330] He also has his own charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation, which is based in Akron.[331] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon in Akron to raise money for various causes.[332] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[333] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit about Muhammad Ali.[334]","In March 2008, James became the first black man—and third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney—to appear on the cover of Vogue, posing with Gisele Bündchen.[337] Some sports bloggers and columnists considered the cover offensive, describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his light-skinned love interest.[335][336]","James has taken stances on controversial issues throughout his career, mentioning on several occasions a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[338] Those include the War in Darfur,[339][340][341][342] the Trayvon Martin case,[343] NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[338] the Michael Brown verdict,[344] and the death of Eric Garner.[345] In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee to elect Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.[346] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[347] It was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[347] James later publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential election.[348]"
Drake_(entertainer),"Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986)[1] is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor.[2][3] Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career as a rapper, he departed the series in 2007 following the release of his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement.

His next two releases were 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same,[6][7][8][9] with certifications of quadruple and triple platinum respectively in the U.S., with the former also earning him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. They were followed by two mixtapes, with the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late, and a collaboration with Future for What a Time to Be Alive, in 2015. The former was certified double platinum in the U.S.[10]","Drake released his fourth album, Views, in 2016, breaking several chart records in the process.[11] The dancehall-influenced Views sat atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks,[12] becoming the first album by a solo male to do so in over 10 years. Its single ""One Dance"" topped the chart in several countries, including the U.S., the UK and Canada, where it became his first number-one single as the lead artist. This saw Drake leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 simultaneously for eight weeks, coming close to a record held by Whitney Houston.[13] It achieved quadruple platinum status in the U.S., and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release.[14][15] The single ""Hotline Bling"" secured him his second and third Grammy win, for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, at the organization's 59th ceremony.[16]","Drake released the critically acclaimed[17] multi-genre More Life in 2017.

Bass guitarist Larry Graham and the late songwriter Teenie Hodges are his paternal uncles.[25][26][27][28][29] Drake's mother, Sandi Graham (née Sher), is a white Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. Drake attended a Jewish day school, and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony.[30][31][32]","Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father chose to return to Memphis in order to find a way to supplement himself financially.[30][31][32] As a child, he witnessed his father's arrest while visiting him in Memphis.[33][34] His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells for a song entitled ""Drake's Dad"", detailing the events that had occurred following his departure from Drake's early life.[35]","Drake was raised in two polarizing Toronto neighbourhoods; he lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end,[33] until the sixth grade. In his youth, he played minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings.[36] Drake then moved to one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000.[37][38] When asked about the move to Forest Hill, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""","He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school.[39] He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighbourhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighbourhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to. [It's tough].""[33] Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background,[40] and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school.[41] He later graduated in October 2012.[42]","At 15, Drake encountered an acting agent who was the father of a high school friend.[43] The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks,[44] a basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate.

The song made Drake become the first ever unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007.[47] The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour.[citation needed] Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""I Want This Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"".[citation needed] Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.","In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone.

Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people.

This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller.[246] Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"".

I do take it very seriously as a new job and a new chapter in my life.""[272][273]","Drake has had four songs being certified triple platinum in the U.S. for combined sales plus streaming units[274] as of July 2016, with ""Best I Ever Had"",[275] ""Jumpman"",[276] ""Over"",[277] and ""Hold On, We're Going Home"".[278] He has also had three exceed 4 million in equivalent units, with ""Take Care"" and ""Headlines"",[279][280] while ""Hotline Bling"" was certified quintuple platinum with over 5 million units.[281] Drake's first four solo studio albums, all of which have gone platinum, have received numerous awards and generally positive reviews.[282] Views, his fourth solo album, became his fourth consecutive number one album in the U.S.[283]","As of 2017, Drake has won a total of 3 Grammy Award from 27 nominations.[284] He has also won 2 MTV Video Music Awards, and has been ranked by Complex at number one on their ""Best Rapper Alive Every Year Since 1979"" list, awarding Drake the accolade in 2011, 2012, and 2015.[285] Billboard editor Ernest Baker stated ""Drake managed to rule Hip hop in 2014"", adding ""The best rapper in 2014 didn't need a new album or hit single to prove his dominance"".[286] Drake was listed fourth on the Billboard year-end chart for Top Artists of 2015,[287] third on the same chart in 2016[288] and was named the IFPI Global Recording Artist of 2016.[289]","The Pitchfork online music publication ranked Nothing Was the Same as the 41st best album of the decade ""so far""—between 2010 and 2014,[290] and have ranked him in the fifth position in the publication's list of the ""Top 10 Music Artists"" since 2010.[291][292]"
Bill_Gates,"William Henry ""Bill"" Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author, and philanthropist.[1][2] In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, and was the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[3][a] Gates has authored and co-authored several books.","Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people[6] and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 2007, again in 2009, and has been since 2014.[7] Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to more than US$82 billion.[8] Between 2013 and 2014, his wealth increased by US$15 billion.[9] Gates is currently the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$86.9 billion as of April 2017.[10] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they, and other billionaires, pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[11]","Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion that has in some cases been upheld by numerous court rulings.[12] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, established in 2000.","Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[13] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work, and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[14] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[15] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014, taking on a new post as technology adviser to support the then newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[16]",,,"Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (born 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[17][18] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or ""Trey"" because his father had the ""II"" suffix.[19] Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.[20] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[21][22][23] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that ""it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing"".[24]","At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[25] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[26] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, ""There was just something neat about the machine.""[27] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students –  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans –  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[28][29]","At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in Cobol, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with ""a disproportionate number of interesting girls.""[30] He later stated that ""it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.""[27] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[31] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[32]","Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973, and was a National Merit Scholar.[33] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests[34] and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[35] He chose a pre-law major but took rigorous mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[36] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft before resigning from the company in 2014.[37]","In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[38] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[38][39] its successor is faster by only one percent.[38] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[40]","Gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at Harvard[41] and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[42] The following year saw the release of the MITS Altair 8800 based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[43] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start his own company.[41] Gates explained his official status with Harvard that, ""...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence].""[44]","After reading the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800, Gates contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[45] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[46] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership ""Micro-Soft"" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[46] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name ""Microsoft"" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[46] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.","Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair ""hobby market"" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[47] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[46] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[45]","During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[48][unreliable source?]","IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 regarding its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[49] The computer company first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[50] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[51]","Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[51] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[52] Despite IBM's name on the operating system the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were ""the man behind the machine?"",[49] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating ""it's Gates' computer"".[53] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[45]","Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate.[54]","From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant to others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that ""Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.""[55] Another executive recalled that after he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times, when they met again a month later Gates ""won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor.""[56]","As an executive, Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. Firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[57][58] He interrupted presentations with such comments ""That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!""[59] and ""Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?""[60] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[59] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, ""I'll do it over the weekend.""[61][62][63]","Gates was an active software developer in Microsoft's early history, particularly on the company's programming language products, but his role most of its history was primarily as management and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[64] but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company's products.[62] He remained interested in technical details; Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 that when watching Gates announcing Microsoft Excel, ""Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.""[65] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors, placing Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[66]","Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, ""compete"", ""concerned"", and ""we"". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[67] BusinessWeek reported:","Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[68]","Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, ""Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree.""[69] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[69]","Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft in 2008. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[70] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a ""Yes"", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a ""Yes"". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about ""nothing"" (Seinfeld).[71] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[72]","Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.","According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his fortune increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[73] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside Satya Nadella.[16][74]","In a substantial interview with Rolling Stone magazine, published in March 27, 2014 issue, Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues, such as climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: ""... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism."" Gates also identified innovation as the ""real driver of progress"" and pronounced that ""America's way better today than it's ever been.""[75] Gates' days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[76]","Gates married Melinda French in Hawaii on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (born 1996), Rory John (born 1999), and Phoebe Adele (born 2002). The family resides in the Gates' home, an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in the state of Washington, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property tax is $991,000. The 66,000 sq ft (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500 sq ft (230 m2) gym and a 1,000 sq ft (93 m2) dining room.[77]","In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith:","The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[78]","In the same interview, Gates said: ""I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.""[78]","Among Gates' private acquisitions is the Codex Leicester, a collection of writings by Leonardo da Vinci, which Gates bought for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994.[79] Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[80] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[81][82]","Gates was number one on the Forbes 400 list from 1993 through to 2007, and number one on Forbes list of The World's Richest People from 1995 to 2007 and 2009. In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, causing the media to call Gates a ""centibillionaire"".[83] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel Gates usually flew coach until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[84] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[85] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[86][87] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[88][89] (but then lost the top position back to Gates).","Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[90] He founded Corbis, a digital imaging company, in 1989. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[91] In 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind when discussing his gaming habits.[92]","Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and in 1994, sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the ""William H. Gates Foundation."" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion.[93][94] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[95][96]","The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[97]","Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[98] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity;[99] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[100]","The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[101]","Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[102] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the ""Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge."" The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[103][104][105]","Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit ""ask me anything"", he stated that",First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[106][107][108][109],"In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would ""highly recommend"" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[110]","Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the ""William H. Gates Building"" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[111]","The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[112] Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[113]","On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself dumping a bucket of ice water on his head, after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so, in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[114]","Bill Gates and his foundation are taking an interest in solving global sanitation problems since about 2005, for example by announcing the ""Reinvent the Toilet Challenge"" which has received considerable media interest.[115] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Bill Gates drank water which was ""produced from human feces"" in 2014 – in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[116][117] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[118]","Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[119]","In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies which have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.[120] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[121] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[122] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[123] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[124] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate 50 million dollars to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[125][126]","Bill Gates partnered with Swiss Tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a non competitive tennis match to a packed Key Arena in Seattle on April 29, 2017.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,[155][156] Cyrus began working with Wayne Coyne on her fifth studio album.[157] She claimed that she was taking her time to focus on the music, and that the album would not be released until she felt it was ready.[158] Coyne compared his collaborative material with Cyrus to the catalogs of Pink Floyd and Portishead, and described their sound as being ""a slightly wiser, sadder, more true version"" of Cyrus' pop music output.[159] During most of the time she was recording of the album, she was in a romantic relationship with actor Patrick Schwarzenegger.[78][160] Cyrus also worked on the films The Night Before (2015) and A Very Murray Christmas (2015) during this period; both roles were cameos.[161] Reports began to surface in 2015 that Cyrus was working on two albums simultaneously, one of which she hoped to release at no charge.[162] This was confirmed by her manager who claimed she was willing to end her contract with RCA Records if they refused to let her release a free album.[162] Cyrus was the host of the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, and gave a surprise performance of a new song ""Dooo It!"" (2015) during the show's finale.[163] Immediately following the performance, Cyrus revealed that her fifth studio album, Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), was available for free streaming on SoundCloud.[163] The album was written and produced primarily by Cyrus, and has been called experimental and psychedelic,[164][165][166] with elements of psychedelic pop,[167][168] psychedelic rock,[169] and alternative pop.[170]","Following the release of her fifth studio album, Cyrus resumed working on her upcoming sixth studio album.[171][172] She was a key adviser during the tenth season of the reality singing competition The Voice.[173] After months of speculation, it was confirmed in March 2016 that Cyrus had rekindled her relationship with Liam Hemsworth.[174][175] That same month, it was announced that Cyrus had signed on as a judge for the eleventh season of The Voice as a replacement for Gwen Stefani; Cyrus is the youngest judge to appear in any incarnation of the series.[176]","In September 2016, Cyrus co-starred in Crisis in Six Scenes, a television series Woody Allen created for Amazon Studios. She plays the part of a radical activist who causes chaos in a conservative 1960s household while hiding from the police.[177][178] On September 17, 2016, she appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon where she sang Bob Dylan’s ""Baby, I’m In the Mood for You"", a rendition that Fallon called ""fantastic"".[179]","On October 27, 2016, Cyrus confirmed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that the ring she is wearing is an engagement ring and that she is engaged to Liam Hemsworth.[180] In the May 13, 2017, issue of Billboard, Cyrus announced that the first single from her sixth album, ""Malibu"", would debut May 11.[181]","Cyrus has cited artists such as: Madonna, Dolly Parton, Timbaland, Joan Jett, Lil Kim, Shania Twain, Hanson, Britney Spears as influences.[182][183][184][185][186][187] Cyrus specifically credits Britney Spears as her biggest inspiration, and references the singer in her song ""Party in the U.S.A."" (2009).[188][189] Since the start of her musical career, Cyrus has been described as being predominantly a pop artist.[190] Her Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus debut studio effort was characterized as sounding similar to her releases as ""Hannah Montana"" featuring a pop-rock and bubblegum pop sound.[191][192] Cyrus hoped that the release of Breakout (2008) would help distance her from this sound; the project features Cyrus experimenting with various genres.[193][194] Cyrus co-wrote eight songs for the album, and was quoted as saying: ""I just hope this record showcases that, more than anything, I'm a writer.""[60] The songs on her early releases feature lyrics on the topics of love and relationships.[190]","Cyrus is an alto,[195] with a ""Nashville twang"" in both her speech and singing voice.[101] On ""Party in the U.S.A."" (2009), her vocals feature belter refrains,[196] while those on the song ""Obsessed"" (2009) are described as ""husky"".[197] Releases such as ""The Climb"" (2009) and ""These Four Walls"" (2008) feature elements of country music and showcase Cyrus's ""twangy vocals"".[198] Cyrus experiments with an electropop sound on ""Fly on the Wall"" (2008), a genre that she would explore further with the release of Can't Be Tamed (2010), her third studio album.[199] It was initially intended to feature rock music elements prior to its completion,[200] and Cyrus claimed after its release that it could be her final pop album.[201] The album's songs speak of Cyrus' desire to achieve freedom in both her personal life and her career.[201] She began working on Bangerz (2013) during a musical hiatus, and described the project as having a ""dirty south feel"" prior to its release.[202] Critics noted the use of hip hop music and synthpop in the album.[203] The album's songs are placed in chronological order telling the story of her failed relationship with Liam Hemsworth.[204] Cyrus described Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015) as ""a little psychedelic, but still in that pop world"".[158]","Cyrus has become known for her controversial performances, most notably during her Bangerz Tour (2014) and Milky Milky Milk Tour (2015).[205] Her performance of ""Party In the U.S.A."" at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards sparked a ""national uproar"" because of her outfit and her perceived pole dancing.[206][207] She faced similar controversy following a performance of ""Can't Be Tamed"" (2010) on Britain's Got Talent, where she pretended to kiss one of her female dancers on stage.[208] Cyrus defended the performance, feeling she did nothing wrong.[208] Cyrus was the subject of public and media scrutiny following her performance of ""We Can't Stop"" (2013) and ""Blurred Lines"" (2013) with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Clad in a skin colored latex two-piece, Cyrus touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch.[209] Shortly thereafter, the word ""twerk"" was added to the online version of the Oxford Dictionary of English.[210] The performance resulted in a media frenzy; one reviewer likened the performance to a ""bad acid trip"",[136] while another described it as a ""trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment"".[211] Cyrus entered the stage of her Bangerz Tour (2014) by sliding down a slide in the shape of a tongue, gaining media attention during the tour for her costumes and racy performances.[212][213] She performed on her Milky Milky Milk Tour (2015) wearing fake breasts and a prosthetic penis.[205]","Throughout her career, Cyrus has sung on several charity singles such as: ""Just Stand Up!"", ""Send It On"", ""Everybody Hurts"" and ""We Are the World 25 for Haiti"".[214][215][216][217] She has visited a number of sick fans in hospitals throughout the years.[218][219] She is an avid supporter of the City of Hope National Medical Center in California, having attended benefit concerts in 2008, 2009 and 2012.[220][221][222] In 2008 and 2009, during her Best of Both Worlds and Wonder World Tours, for every concert ticket sold, she donated one dollar to the organization.[223] Cyrus celebrated her sixteenth birthday at Disneyland by delivering a $1 million donation from Disney to Youth Service America.[224] In July 2009, Cyrus performed at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation's 20th annual A Time for Heroes celebrity picnic[225] and donated several items including autographed merchandise, and a script from Hannah Montana for the Ronald McDonald House Auction.[226] Cyrus supports charities such as: the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Entertainment Industry Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, United Service Organizations, Youth Service America and Music for Relief.[227][228][229][230][231][232] In February 2010, she donated several items, including the dress she wore to the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, and two tickets to the Hollywood premiere of her movie The Last Song, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[233]","In January 2011, Cyrus met an ailing fan with spina bifida with the charity Kids Wish Network.[234] In April 2011, she appeared in a commercial for the American Red Cross asking people to pledge $10 to help those affected by the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami.[235] In the same year Hilary Duff presented Cyrus with the first ever Global Action Youth Leadership Award at the first Annual Global Action Awards Gala for her support of Blessings in a Backpack, an organization that works to feed hungry children in schools, and her personal Get Ur Good On campaign with the Youth Services of America. Cyrus stated: ""I want (kids) to do something they love. Not something that seems like a chore because someone tells them that's the right thing to do or what their parents want or what's important to people around them, but what's in their heart.""[236][237] In December 2011, she appeared in a commercial for the charity J/P Haitian Relief Organization, and teamed up with her elder brother Trace Cyrus to design a limited edition T-shirt and hoodie for charity. All proceeds from the sale of these items went to her charity, Get Ur Good On, which supports education for under-privileged children.[238][239] In the same month, she performed her song ""The Climb"" at the CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.[240]","In 2012, Cyrus released a cover version of Bob Dylan's ""You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go"" featuring Johnzo West for the charity Amnesty International as a part of the album Chimes of Freedom.[241] She also appeared in a commercial for the Rock the Vote campaign which encouraged young people to make their voices heard by voting in the 2012 federal election.[242] For her twentieth birthday, activists at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) adopted a pig called Nora in her name.[243][244] Cyrus also supports thirty-nine well-known charities including: Make-a-Wish Foundation, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, To Write Love on Her Arms, NOH8 Campaign, Love Is Louder Than the Pressure to Be Perfect and The Jed Foundation among others.[245][246][247] In 2013, Cyrus was named the fourteenth most charitable celebrity of the year by Do Something.[248] She also appeared with Justin Bieber and Pitbull in a television special entitled The Real Change Project: Artists for Education.[249] On July 26, 2014, it was announced that Cyrus would appear alongside Justin Timberlake at an HIV/AIDS charity event in the White House.[250]","At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Jimmy Fallon announced that Cyrus was the winner of the Video of the Year award for her song ""Wrecking Ball"". Instead of accepting the award herself, she had a twenty-two-year-old homeless man by the name of Jesse collect it for her. She had met him at My Friend’s Place, an organization that helps homeless youth find shelter, work, health care and education. His acceptance speech encouraged musicians to learn more about homeless youth in Los Angeles and what they can do to help at Cyrus's Facebook page.[251] Cyrus then launched a Prizeo campaign to raise funds for the charity. Those who made donations were automatically entered into a sweepstake for a chance to meet Cyrus on her Bangerz Tour in Rio de Janeiro that September.[252]","In the early years of her career, Cyrus had a generally wholesome image as a teen idol.[253] Her fame increased dramatically following the Vanity Fair photo scandal, and it was reported that photos of Cyrus could be shopped for $2,000 apiece.[253] In the following years, Cyrus' image continued to shift dramatically, differing from her previous teen idol status.[253] Donny Osmond wrote of Cyrus' transition into adulthood: ""Miley will have to face adulthood..... As she does, she'll want to change her image, and that change will be met with adversity.""[254] The release of Can't Be Tamed (2010) saw Cyrus officially attempting to distance herself from her teenage years, releasing controversial music videos for her songs ""Can't Be Tamed"" (2010) and ""Who Owns My Heart"" (2010).[255][256] Her behavior generated a considerable amount of controversy throughout 2013 and 2014, though godmother Dolly Parton stated ""...the girl can write. The girl can sing. The girl is smart. And she doesn't have to be so drastic. But I will respect her choices. I did it my way, so why can't she do it her way?""[257] Cyrus was placed at number seventeen on Forbes' list of the most powerful celebrities in 2014, with the magazine noting that ""The last time she made our list was when she was still rolling in Hannah Montana money. Now the pop singer is all grown up and courting controversy at every turn.""[258] In August 2014, it was reported that Bluewater Productions has documented her life in a comic book called Fame: Miley Cyrus, starting with her controversial 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance to her Disney fame, and exploring her childhood in Tennessee.[259] The comic book was written by Michael L. Frizell and drawn by Juan Luis Rincón, and is available in both print and digital formats.[260]","In September 2010, Cyrus was ranked number ten on Billboard magazine's first ever list of Music's Hottest Minors of 2010,[261] and was ranked number twenty-one on the 2011,[262] and number eighteen on the 2012 version of the list.[263] In May 2013, Maxim ranked Cyrus first on their Hot 100 of the year.[264] Cyrus was chosen by Time as one of their finalists for Person of the Year in November 2013.[265] She came in third place with 16.3% of the vote.[266] In March 2014, Skidmore College, New York started offering a special topics sociology course entitled ""The Sociology of Miley Cyrus: Race, Class, Gender and Media"" which was ""using Miley as a lens through which to explore sociological thinking about identity, entertainment, media and fame"".[267] In 2015, Cyrus was listed as one of the nine runners-up for The Advocate's Person of the Year.[268]","Cyrus was raised as a Christian and identified herself as such during her childhood and early adult life.[18] Some recent quotes such as ""You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded... So forget Jesus. Stars died so you can live"", and social media content have led to questions surrounding her religious beliefs.[269][270] Cyrus includes references to Tibetan Buddhism in the lyrics of ""Milky Milky Milk"" (2015).[271] Cyrus came out as pansexual to her mother when she was 14,[272][273][274] and has said: ""I never want to label myself! I am ready to love anyone that loves me for who I am! I am open.""[275] In June 2015, Time reported that she also identifies as gender fluid.[276] She was quoted as stating she ""[doesn't] relate to being boy or girl, and I don't have to have my partner relate to boy or girl.""[270] Cyrus is a supporter of the LGBT community, and is often vocal about her beliefs on the topic.[277] Her song ""My Heart Beats For Love"" (2010) was written for one of Cyrus' gay friends,[278] while she has since claimed that London is her favorite place to perform due to its extensive gay scene.[279] Cyrus also has an equals sign tattooed on her ring finger in support of same-sex marriage.[280] She is the founder of the Happy Hippie Foundation, which works to ""fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations"".[281] Cyrus is open about her recreational use of cannabis.[282][283] She told Rolling Stone in 2013 that it was ""the best drug on earth"" and called it, along with MDMA, a ""happy drug"".[284] While accepting the Best Video award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus smoked what appeared to be a joint on stage; this was removed from the delayed broadcast of the program in the United States.[285] In a 2014 interview with W, Cyrus stated ""I love weed"" and ""I just love getting stoned.""[286]",PETA named Cyrus the Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity of 2015.[287],In a Billboard interview Cyrus revealed that she was sober.[288],Miley Cyrus' net worth is estimated at $200 million in 2017.

SportsCenter,"SportsCenter is a daily sports news television program that serves as the flagship program of American cable and satellite television network ESPN. Originally broadcast only once per day, SportsCenter now has up to twelve airings each day; the program features highlights and updates, and reviews scores from the day's (or depending on the airtime, the previous day's) major sporting events, along with commentary, analysis previewing upcoming games, feature segments, and news stories from around the sports world.","Since it premiered upon the network's launch on September 7, 1979, the show has aired more than 50,000 unique episodes, more than any other program on American television; SportsCenter is broadcast from ESPN's studio facilities in Bristol, Connecticut and Los Angeles, California.[2][3] In addition to airing simulcasts or network-exclusive editions on sister networks ESPN2 and ESPNews, the program also produces short in-game updates during sports events aired on ABC as well as an interstitial play countdown segment for fellow sister network Disney XD. ESPN is currently sponsoring SportsCenter and many other productions.",,,"SportsCenter airs live each weekday from 7:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., 6:00 p.m., 11:00 p.m., midnight, and 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time (with the early-evening broadcast typically running for 60 or 90 minutes, and the late editions typically running 60 minutes each). The 1:00 a.m. edition is often repeated until 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time. On Sundays, an hour-long episode airs at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, with another edition of varying length airing at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time; the 11:00 p.m. (Eastern) edition airs for 90 minutes on Sundays and is repeated throughout the night.","In the event of live sports coverage on the network, the program is occasionally delayed or moved to either ESPN2 or ESPNews (depending on whether one of the networks is carrying an event) until the event concludes. The program also is known to start early and run long, if the preceding game ends ahead of schedule or if breaking news warrants. Since 2009, the 1:00 a.m. Eastern edition of SportsCenter has been produced live from Los Angeles; that edition also is repeated during the overnight hours. ESPN also produces short 90-second capsules known as the SportsCenter Update, which air at select points within game telecasts on the network and sister broadcast network ABC to provide updates of other ongoing and recently concluded sporting events.","In addition to providing game highlights and news from the day in sports outside of the scheduled slate of games (including team player and management transactions, injury reports and other news), the program also features live reports from sites of sports events scheduled to be held or already concluded, extensive analysis of completed and upcoming sports events from sport-specific analysts and special contributors, and feature segments providing interviews with players, coaches and franchise management in the headlines.","Some sports leagues and organizations, including the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL) and college athletic conferences that are members of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), allow for brief highlights to be shown while a game is in progress. From 2006 to 2013, Major League Baseball only allowed ongoing game highlights to air during SportsCenter within the Baseball Tonight Extra segments in the broadcast. The National Football League (NFL) does not permit the use of highlights for games that are ongoing at all, outside of those featured within its own live game broadcasts on the league's broadcast partners.","ESPN is traditionally unable to air highlights of Olympic events until after they have aired on tape-delay on NBC (which currently holds the American rights to the Olympic Games through 2032) or its co-owned sister cable networks. ESPN began showing more Olympics highlights on-air and online beginning with the 2006 Winter Olympics, with the network obtaining these extended rights from NBC as part of the 2006 deal that saw ABC release Al Michaels from his contract, in order to join John Madden and key production personnel for the new NBC Sunday Night Football (this same deal also reverted rights to the Walt Disney-produced Oswald The Lucky Rabbit cartoons from Universal Pictures, which originally distributed the shorts).[4][title missing]","In addition, there are many anecdotal reports of various television networks (such as CBS Sports, NBC Sports and beIN Sport) that will not release highlights of certain sporting events to ESPN, unless the originating U.S. broadcaster's name is displayed on-screen for the entire length of the highlight (for example, ""Courtesy NBC Sports"").","Starting in 2007 and until its final season of broadcasting in 2014, ESPN stopped displaying the actual name of the NASCAR Nationwide Series or Sprint Cup Series race during highlights of such events (for example, the ""Allstate 400 at the Brickyard"" was referred to as the ""Brickyard 400 pres. by Golden Corral""), unless the title sponsor of the race is paid for to the network; a similar stipulation also applies to the network's IndyCar Series coverage.","SportsCenter was conceived in 1979, and created by ESPN executives Chet Simmons and Scotty Connal.[5] The program was originally anchored by Chris Berman, George Grande, Greg Gumbel, Lee Leonard, Bob Ley, Sal Marchiano and Tom Mees (Berman and Ley are the only ones that remain employed with the network, as of July 2016[update]).","Grande introduced the country to ESPN when he co-anchored the premiere episode of SportsCenter on September 7, 1979 with Leonard, a longtime New York City sports broadcaster. According to Entertainment Weekly, Leonard said in the opening of the show: ""If you're a fan, what you will see in the next minutes, hours, and days to follow may convince you that you've gone to sports heaven.""[6] Grande spent ten more years with ESPN and SportsCenter until he left the network in 1989.","Another early addition to the show was Chris Berman, who joined ESPN one month after its launch and became a fixture of the program until the early 1990s, when his main efforts became focused on the network's NFL coverage and Baseball Tonight; however, Berman remains a part of SportsCenter, including occasionally serving as a substitute anchor. Ley also began anchoring early in the show's history and still regularly appears on the Sunday morning edition of the program, in addition to hosting Outside the Lines.","In 1988, the program's format was changed by executive producer Walsh from focusing on individual sports or leagues to a ""newspaper style"" structure. As a result, the program began airing stories based on their importance, regardless of the sport.[7]","The program's title sequence during its early years included various kinds of sports balls flying outward, set to a rapid-fire electronic music version of ""Pulstar"" by Vangelis. By 1989, the first of several theme songs to incorporate ESPN's trademark six-note fanfare (often referred to as sounding in the manner of ""duh-nuh-nuh, duh-nuh-nuh"") went into use. The theme music was originally composed by John Colby, who served as ESPN’s music director from 1984 to 1992, and created and produced music for various sporting events and programs seen on the network.[8] The current version of the theme was composed in 2006 by Annie Roboff, who also co-wrote Faith Hill's 1998 hit ""This Kiss"".[9] Throughout the 1990s, SportsCenter's set underwent many changes.","In 1994, ESPN launched the This is SportsCenter advertising campaign, a series of humorous, tongue-in-cheek spots featuring anchors and crew to promote the show.[10] The team of Dan Patrick and Keith Olbermann – who anchored the 11:00 p.m. (Eastern) edition of the program – achieved great popularity during the late 1980s and the 1990s (interrupted by Olbermann's brief move to spin-off channel ESPN2 upon that network's launch in 1993). After Olbermann left ESPN in 1997, Kenny Mayne became Patrick's co-anchor on the late broadcast; when Patrick was moved to the 6:00 p.m. edition, Rich Eisen and Stuart Scott became the show's primary anchor team.","In 2001, Toronto-based Bell Globemedia and ESPN (which received a minority stake) jointly acquired the Canadian sports network TSN. As part of its shift to ESPN-influenced branding, the specialty channel rebranded its existing sports news program SportsDesk and changed its name to SportsCentre – using the same introductions and theme music as the ESPN version, except with its title rendered using Canadian spelling.","On September 11, 2001, ESPN interrupted regular programming at 11:05 a.m. Eastern Time to cover the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, and the aborted related hijacking-turned-plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania through a simulcast of sister network ABC's news coverage. ESPN considered suspending that night's editions of SportsCenter, and network management debated the topic for about an hour. Finally, a half-hour edition of the program aired that evening, featuring reports on the impact that the attacks had on the sports world, announcing the cancellations of major U.S. sporting events that had been announced up to that time.[11]","On June 7, 2004, SportsCenter began broadcasting in high definition. Along with the conversion, the program introduced a new set designed by Walt Disney Imagineering (situated in a studio located at ESPN's new ""Digital Center""), and a new graphics package titled ""Revolution"" that was developed by Troika Design Group.[12] During that summer, ESPN celebrated its 25th anniversary, by counting down the top 100 moments in sports over the previous 25 years. The countdown was seen on each SportsCenter broadcast daily beginning on May 31, 2004; the countdown concluded with the #1 moment, the United States men's national ice hockey team's victory over the USSR during the 1980 Winter Olympics, airing on September 7, 2004.","During the summer of 2005, SportsCenter premiered a segment called ""50 States in 50 Days"", where a different SportsCenter anchor traveled to a different state each day to discover the sports, sports history, and athletes of the state.[13]","On April 4, 2006, SportsCenter began to show highlights of Major League Baseball games in progress at the program's airtime; the rights to broadcast these highlights while games were ongoing was previously given exclusivity to fellow ESPN program, Baseball Tonight; the in-progress highlights are shown as part of the ""Baseball Tonight Extra"" segment. Prior to that date, video footage from MLB games was not shown on any SportsCenter broadcasts until the games completed play.","On February 11, 2007, following the NBA game between the Chicago Bulls and the Phoenix Suns, SportsCenter aired its 30,000th broadcast. The special milestone edition was anchored by Steve Levy and Stuart Scott; Bob Ley, Chris Berman and Dan Patrick made guest appearances to recap events as well as bloopers from the first 10,000 shows (all three men individually counted down each set of 10,000 clips).[14][15] ESPN also debuted the SportsCenter Minute, a one-minute SportsCenter update that is streamed exclusively on ESPN.com.","Four months later on May 6, another major change to SportsCenter was introduced on that night's 11:00 p.m. (Eastern) edition, with the debut of a ""rundown"" graphic that appears on the right-side third of the screen. This feature was originally only shown during rebroadcasts of the overnight edition on Monday through Saturday nights, and on the main Sunday night telecast;[16] on ESPNHD, the sidebar graphic filled the right pillarbox where the ESPNHD logo would usually appear when standard definition footage was presented.","The 6:00 p.m. edition of SportsCenter moved one hour earlier to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 28, 2007; at that time, the early-evening edition was, for the first time, expanded to three hours. During that broadcast, ESPN aired live coverage of Roger Clemens' second start for the New York Yankees' minor league affiliate in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time edition of SportsCenter on August 7, 2007, which was anchored by John Buccigross and Cindy Brunson, showed live coverage of Barry Bonds's 756th career home run, which broke the old MLB record set by Hank Aaron (ESPN was carrying the game live on ESPN2). In August 2008, the former WWE employee Jonathan Coachman joined ESPN to anchor the show.","On August 11, 2008, during the opening week of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, SportsCenter began airing live from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The original plan was to start the live block three hours earlier at 6:00 a.m. Eastern; however, the network decided to scale back the length of the daytime broadcast before the expansion occurred.[17]","That same year, Hannah Storm (former NBC Sports reporter and anchor of CBS's The Early Show) joined ESPN to anchor the 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. block of the program.[18] The new format included two teams of two anchors in three-hour shifts:","In addition, Sage Steele would provide updates every 30 minutes from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.[19] The changes also included a new website for the program – SportsCenter.com, which launched on August 11, 2008 – to promote more interaction with viewers.[17] To promote these changes, ESPN held an employee casting call to see who would be featured in almost 25 live and unscripted commercials per day. Steve Braband, an International Programmer for the network, won, and was featured in ads shown about every half-hour (excluding from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on ESPN. Additionally, the network launched the website, steveislive.com, featuring Braband's daily appearance schedule, blog, and video clips of past appearances and audition footage.","Upon that network's launch on February 13, 2009, SportsCenter began producing a countdown segment, the SportsCenter High-5, for sister channel Disney XD (which is owned by ESPN majority owner The Walt Disney Company).[20][21]","On April 6, 2009 (starting with the 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time edition, which was anchored by Hannah Storm and Sage Steele), SportsCenter debuted a new graphics package that saw the ""rundown"" graphic – shown during the daytime editions – being shifted to the left side of the screen. On that same date, SportsCenter began producing its 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time edition of SportsCenter live from ESPN's production facilities in the newly constructed L.A. Live complex (just across from the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. The set is virtually identical to the setup at the main facilities in Bristol, and the late-night West Coast broadcast would be produced as simply another edition of the program. Neil Everett and Stan Verrett were appointed as the primary anchors for the Los Angeles-based editions of SportsCenter. A new BottomLine ticker was also unveiled that day on four of the five ESPN networks (ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Classic and ESPNU); the redesigned ticker was quickly dropped, reverting to the old BottomLine design – which had been in use since April 2003 – due to an equipment failure (however, this ticker was operational for the 2009 NFL Draft and the 2009 NBA Draft). After technical issues with the revamped BottomLine were fixed, the new BottomLine was reinstated on July 8.","The 2009 U.S. Open Golf Championship, which was repeatedly delayed due to weather, aired on both NBC and ESPN. Portions of ESPN's broadcast, including the early parts of the Monday final round, were presented under the ""SportsCenter at the U.S. Open"" banner – using a similar branding as the segments-within-the-show focusing on nightly highlights and analysis of a particular event originating from the event locations (such as ""SportsCenter at the Super Bowl"" and ""SportsCenter at the World Series""). In August 2009, Robert Flores – co-anchor of the program's 12:00 to 3:00 p.m. block – was replaced on the early-afternoon broadcasts with John Buccigross.","On August 30, 2010, ESPN expanded SportsCenter to ESPNEWS, airing an additional seven hours of the program in separate blocks from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time.[1][22] By late 2010, the ""rundown"" graphic was expanded to all editions of SportsCenter. On April 22, 2011, Josh Elliott – original and main co-anchor of the 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time block of SportsCenter – left ESPN to become news anchor for ABC's Good Morning America and was replaced on the late morning block of the program by Kevin Negandhi.","By mid-2011, shortly after ESPN and ESPN2 both converted to a 16:9 letterbox format (in compliance with the #10 AFD code) on their primary standard definition feeds, SportsCenter began showing all high-definition and standard-definition footage in the appropriate aspect ratio on the SD feed (with stylized pillarboxes adorned with the ESPN logo used on footage presented in standard definition). That same year on October, the former WWE employee Todd Grisham joined ESPN to anchor the show. The move required the letterboxed image to be shrunk in order to be displayed in that manner, with the ""rundown"" graphic continuing to be placed on the left side of the screen. In August 2011, John Anderson – who previously served as the 11:00 p.m. (Eastern) anchor – was moved to the early-evening 6:00 p.m. broadcast, replacing Brian Kenny (who departed ESPN to become a program host for the MLB Network). ESPN launched a completely redesigned SportsCenter.com website on October 16, 2011.","On August 25, 2012, the BottomLine was used to acknowledge the death of astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon. It was reportedly only the fifth of six times that an outside news event not involving an athlete was reported on the ticker, alongside the news of the September 11 attacks, the death of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks in 2005, the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States in 2008, the Death of Osama Bin Laden, and the later death of former South African president Nelson Mandela on December 5, 2013.","On December 3, 2012, Lindsay Czarniak became the main co-anchor of the 6:00 p.m. edition of SportsCenter. On February 8 and 9, 2013, the 11:00 p.m. editions of SportsCenter on both nights were broadcast from Los Angeles, due to a massive snowstorm in the Northeastern United States that prevented some staff from conducting the program out of ESPN's Bristol headquarters. Stan Verrett anchored both editions from the network's Los Angeles studios.","In late March 2013, David Lloyd and Sage Steele – both of whom were previously co-anchored the weekend morning editions – moved to the weekday early-afternoon block (from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. Eastern). The current daytime format, which was implemented that month, now features three teams of two anchors in two-hour shifts. On June 21, 2013, a large LED high definition monitor placed behind the main anchor desk was added to the main SportsCenter set in the network's Bristol facility.","In February 2014, production of the weeknight 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) editions of SportsCenter was temporarily relocated back to Bristol, due to renovations being made at the network's SportsCenter studio in Los Angeles. In addition, Neil Everett and Stan Verrett – both of whom had anchored SportsCenter from Los Angeles since 2009 – were moved back to the network's headquarters, before both hosts and the program's production returned to the then-newly renovated Los Angeles studio on June 23.","On June 22, 2014, SportsCenter began broadcasting from Studio X of ESPN's new Digital Center 2 facility, which concurrently resulted in a major overhaul to the program's production and on-air appearance. The new studio incorporates over 114 displays – including two touchscreens, large vertical screens, and a ""multidimensional"" video wall consisting of 56 monitors of varying sizes and positions that can be used to create pseudo-3D effects. The monitor displays can be used to show video content (such as highlights) and other relevant imagery (such as statistics), emphasizing the ability for anchors to present content on-set through means other than just through voiceovers. A new graphics package was also introduced, emphasizing a bolder, yet more simplified look – in both their appearance and the level of content. To coincide with the redesign of SportsCenter, a revised variant of ESPN's BottomLine ticker was introduced to compliment the new graphical design, using a dark grey color scheme. A downscaled replica of DC2's set was constructed for broadcasts originating from ESPN's Los Angeles studio.[23][24][25][26]","On February 2 and 3, 2015, Lindsay Czarniak anchored the 6:00 p.m. (Eastern) edition of SportsCenter from ESPN's Los Angeles facilities, due to a major snowstorm that hit the Northeastern United States the previous weekend, which also affected ESPN's main facilities in Bristol. The previous week from January 26 to 30, Czarniak had co-anchored the 6:00 p.m. edition alongside John Anderson from the parking lot of the Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, Arizona as part of the program's coverage of Super Bowl XLIX. After that week, Anderson was moved back to the 11:00 p.m. broadcast, making Czarniak the solo anchor of the 6:00 p.m. editions on weeknights starting on February 2.","On September 7, 2015, Scott Van Pelt became the solo anchor of a revised 12:00 a.m. (Eastern) edition of the program, which is more freeform than other SportsCenter editions and promoted as SportsCenter at Night, or SC@Night for short. In addition to featuring highlights and discussion panels, it features Van Pelt's analysis of sports events in a style similar to that conducted on his former radio talk show SVP and Russillo, during the replacement of Danny Kanell as the new co-host of Russillo Show alongside Ryen Russillo,[27] and utilizes a modified version of the show's theme (composed by Timbaland), as well as a different lighting and graphics set.[28]","In October 2015, Ronda Rousey became the first female athlete to guest host on the show.[29]","On February 8, 2016, SportsCenter moved its start time from 9:00 to 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, with the launch of a new three hour morning block from 7:00 to 10:00 a.m., titled SportsCenter:AM.[30] Maintaining a faster paced format, the program focuses on highlights from the previous night in the first hour, the top plays and moments of the previous night's sporting events in the second hour, and the upcoming day in sports in the third hour. SportsCenter:AM also shares resources with Good Morning America and ESPN2/ESPN Radio's Mike & Mike.[31][32]","On October 11, 2016, ESPN named His & Hers co-hosts Jemele Hill and Michael Smith as co-anchors of the 6:00 p.m. ET edition of SportsCenter, effective February 6, 2017 (the day after Super Bowl LI). They replaced Lindsay Czarniak, who had been anchoring the 6:00 p.m. ET edition of the show since December 3, 2012.","On November 13, 2015, ESPN interrupted regular programming around 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, to cover the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks on Stade de France and downtown Paris as well as the hostage situation in the Bataclan theatre, where a concert of American rock band Eagles of Death Metal was interrupted by the terrorists who killed 89 people. ESPN FC correspondent Jonathan Johnson, as well as French president François Hollande, were attending the game in the Stade de France, around which the three explosions occurred. While Hollande evacuated from the stadium at half-time, Johnson remained in the stadium, and after the game he described to the viewers the panic of the fans who attended the game and came to the field, after being noticed by the Stade de France's PA announcer. After the hostage crisis ended, a special edition of the program was aired, featuring analysis and reports on the impact that the Paris attacks had on the sports world and social media reactions of sportspeople to the attacks, announcing the postponements of some major European sporting events that had been announced up to that weekend.","On January 3, 2017, the 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. ET editions of SportsCenter (branded as SportsCenter Face to Face with Hannah Storm and SportsCenter Coast-to-Coast, respectively) moved from ESPN to ESPN2, effectively switching channels with the two-hour debate program First Take, which moved from ESPN2 to ESPN.","On February 6, 2017, the newly-revamped 6:00 p.m. ET of SportsCenter, which is titled SC6 Michael/Jemele, debuted with Michael Smith and Jemele Hill as co-anchors.

In addition, SC6 focuses on the night ahead in sports, as well as breaking sports news as warranted.","On April 26, 2017, SportsCenter anchors Jay Crawford, Chris Hassel, Jade McCarthy and Jaymee Sire (who had co-anchored SportsCenter:AM since its debut on February 8, 2016) were among the 100 staffers who were let go by ESPN.","On March 1, 2010, ESPN launched a special domestic edition of SportsCenter on its European channel ESPN America.

The single is the first single from their fifth studio album, Made in the A.M., and the first material released by the group after Malik's departure.[131] Following the release, it was revealed that the group would going on hiatus in 2016 to take a break.[13] On 22 September, the title for the fifth studio album, Made in the A.M., was officially announced along with promotional single ""Infinity"" being released.[132] The group began to reveal the track listing on their Snapchat stories to which it was later confirmed on iTunes.[133] The album was released on 13 November 2015.[134] At the 2015 American Music Awards on 22 November, One Direction won the award for Artist of the Year for the second year in succession.[135] Louis Tomlinson later confirmed that the break would be around 18 months. On 13 December, One Direction performed on The X Factor final. Their last televised performance as a group, before their hiatus, was on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on 31 December 2015.[136]","On 13 January 2016, Us Weekly published a report claiming that the group's hiatus would become a permanent split, with a ""source"" citing that each of the four remaining group members did not renew their contracts following the completion of the on the Road Again Tour in October 2015.[137] Representatives for the group denied said-report in a statement to Billboard, stating, ""nothing has changed regarding hiatus plans for the group, and all will be revealed in due time from the band members' own mouths.""[138][139] In February, it was confirmed that Harry Styles had left the group's management and may begin a solo career path.[140] In June, it was confirmed that Styles had signed a solo recording contract.[141][142][143] In July, Payne announced that he has signed a solo recording contract with Capitol Records.[144][145] On 29 September, Horan released his solo debut single ""This Town"".[146][147]","One Direction's debut studio album, Up All Night (2011), is predominantly a pop music record, containing elements of teen pop, dance-pop, pop rock, with electropop and rock influences.[152][153][154][155] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey described the album as a ""collection of PG pop rock with killer choruses"",[156] while The New York Times considered it ""full of easy rock-inflected pop, blithe and sometimes clever.""[157] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard acknowledged that the album demonstrates an originality in sound that was ""necessary for the revitalization of the boy band movement"".[155] The songs ""One Thing"" and ""What Makes You Beautiful"" were particularly noted for the genres of power pop and pop rock, for their ""powerhouse"" guitar riffs and ""forceful"" choruses.[148][149][152][158]","Their second studio album, Take Me Home (2012), is characterised by rock-inherited pop, prominent electric guitar riffs, bright synthesisers, a homogeneous sound and message, and the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune.[82][83][84][159][160] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian interpreted its signature sound as a ""peppy, synth-bolstered take on early-80s new-wave pop, heavy on clipped rhythms and chugging guitars,"" which, he said, is at least an improvement on the substitute contemporary R&B ""that was once the grim lot of the boyband.""[83] Jon Caramanica, writing in The New York Times, considered the album ""far more mechanical"" than their debut album, although noted that it is sonically and lyrically similar.[82] The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy and longing for past significant others.[82][83][84][161]","Erica Futterman for Rolling Stone favoured their live acoustic performances as both showing, ""Horan's ability to play guitar, as well as One Direction's admirable live vocals. There was no need to worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show.""[162] Herald Sun's Cameron Adams opined that One Direction have ""strong pop voices"".[163] Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, ""It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere in the midst of all the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain.""[164] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: ""What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert.""[165] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: ""As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out.""[166] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's ""surprisingly accomplished effort"" of Kings of Leon's ""Use Somebody"" proved that One Direction are ""more than capable"" of evolving their sound.[167]","Their third album Midnight Memories (2013) is a pop rock record, a slight departure from the band's original teen pop sound. Liam Payne called Midnight Memories a ""slightly rockier and edgier"" album than their previous material. The album is heavily influenced by 80's rock[168] and folk music and briefly integrates elements of dubstep, notably in ""Little White Lies"". The album's lyrical themes primarily revolve around love, heartbreak and sexual intercourse. Many critics praised its lyrical depth and musical composition, as well as the group's level of involvement in the production process.[169]","Their fourth album Four (2014) was released on 17 November 2014. Payne once again claimed that the album would be ""edgier"" and that the group had written most of the songs for it; Horan came up with the name of the album, commemorating the fact that it is One Direction's fourth record to date and that it has been four years since the band's formation.[170] Signifying a further maturation of their pop sound, the album's first single, Steal My Girl, was dubbed by Billboard as ""no What Makes You Beautiful, but its Coldplay-like piano pop could be a good direction"",[171] and that the band was ""not entirely ready to let go of its bubble-gum days"". Rolling Stone described the record as ""saturated with retro vibes""; its songs ""split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone did last year.""[172]","In 2011, the band performed on the BBC's Children in Need 2011 charity telethon, helping raise over 26 million pounds.[173] In 2012 they extended their involvement with Children in Need as they opened the telecast with a performance of their single ""Live While We're Young"". A prominent annual event in British culture, the group said it was ""incredible"" to be involved in Children in Need as it was something that they had ""always watched as children"".[174]","In February 2013, One Direction released ""One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)"" (a medley of ""One Way or Another"" and ""Teenage Kicks"") as the 2013 single for the UK's other major charity telethon Comic Relief.[92] For ITV's Santa charity Christmas campaign, they filmed a set of pleas to their fans and the general public, asking them to donate £2.[175] The band have made numerous other appearances for charitable causes, including the 2011 Pride of Britain Awards where they presented 13-year-old quadruple amputee Danielle Bailey the Child of Courage award at her school assembly, and the 2014 Royal Variety Performance where they played in front of Prince William and Catherine at the London Palladium.[176][177]","In September 2012, Niall Horan organised an event to raise money for Irish Autism Action and another charity, called Temporary Emergency Accommodation Mullingar, based in his hometown. Due to overwhelming demand to participate in the fundraising, the ticket website for the event broke down. Horan's brother Greg commented on the website crash, saying that ""there were 500 tickets and they were all snapped up pretty quick"".[178]","In 2013, band members Liam Payne and Harry Styles partnered with Trekstock, a leading cancer charity to help raise money for cancer research.[179] As ambassadors of the charity, the duo collaborated to offer the chance for one fan and a friend to win an evening out with them in return for a donation to the charity as part of an exclusive ""#HangwithLiam&Harry"" global campaign. They had originally set a goal of raising $500,000 and ended up raising $784,984. Trekstock later added that this amount would allow them to ""complete funding of their Hodgkin's lymphoma trial, in the hope of offering a much brighter future to thousands of children and young people affected by this form of disease."" One Direction were named the most charitable in 2013 behind Taylor Swift by social change organisation DoSomething.org.[180]","In 2014, One Direction donated £600,000 for the Stand up to Cancer campaign by giving portions of their ticket sales revenues from their Where We Are Tour.[181] On 15 November 2014, One Direction joined the charity group Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa.[182]","Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, in an article on One Direction's success in North America, notes that Americans had left a gap in the market and it took the prominence of Justin Bieber to demonstrate that there still was a market for ""clean cut, wholesome, whiter-than-white, middle class parent friendly pop: cute boys advocating puppy love. And what could be better than one cute boy, if not five?""[183] One Direction have been described as sparking a resurgence in the interest in boy bands, and as forming part of a new ""British Invasion"" in the United States.[184][185][186][187][188][189] Bill Werde, a representative of Billboard magazine, commented, ""There's a lot of possibility here, there's a lot of upside, that level of talent with those kinds of looks, it's really a perfect storm for a massive, massive successful phenomenon.""[190]","Sonny Takhar, the chief executive officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media. ""Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here – it's the act,"" he said. ""It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before.""[190] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, ""These guys live online, and so do their fans.""[189] Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, ""which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans,"" according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian.[190] One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day.[191] In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is ""the cute one"", Malik is ""the quiet and mysterious one"", Payne is ""the sensible one"", Styles is ""the charming one"" and Tomlinson is ""the funny one"".[192] Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, ""At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing."" Instead, her original idea was for them to be the ""male equivalent to the Spice Girls"", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style.[193] Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, ""People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [being] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean.""[194] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front,[194] ""For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys – posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows.""[194] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, ""One Direction fulfil a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here"".[195]",Headlining,Opening act,"One Direction has received five BRIT Awards—winning their first with ""What Makes You Beautiful"" for Best British Single at the 2012 BRIT Awards,[198] three NME awards,[199] two Kids' Choice Awards,[200] and four MTV Video Music Awards,[72] among other awards. One Direction won 27 awards from 29 they have been nominated for at the Teen Choice Awards.[201] One Direction also won two American Music Awards out of their two nominations for Favorite Pop/Rock Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group, respectively."
ESPN,"ESPN (originally an initialism for Entertainment and Sports Programming Networks) is a U.S.-based global cable and satellite sports television channel owned by ESPN Inc., a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company (which operates the network) and the Hearst Corporation (which owns a 20% minority share).","ESPN broadcasts primarily from studio facilities located in Bristol, Connecticut. The network also operates offices in Miami, New York City, Seattle, Charlotte, and Los Angeles. John Skipper currently serves as president of ESPN, a position he has held since January 1, 2012. While ESPN is one of the most successful sports networks, there has been much criticism of ESPN, which includes accusations of biased coverage,[1] conflict of interest, and controversies with individual broadcasters and analysts.","As of February 2015[update], ESPN is available to approximately 94,396,000 paid television households (81.1% of households with at least one television set) in the United States.[2] In addition to the flagship channel and its seven related channels in the United States, ESPN broadcasts in more than 200 countries,[3] operating regional channels in Australia, Brazil, Latin America and the United Kingdom, and owning a 20% interest in The Sports Network (TSN) as well as its five sister networks in Canada.","In 2011, ESPN's history and rise was chronicled by These Guys Have All the Fun, a nonfiction book written by James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales and published by Little, Brown, & Co.[4]",,,"Bill Rasmussen conceived the concept of ESPN in late May 1978, after he was fired from his job with the World Hockey Association's New England Whalers. One of the first steps in Bill and his son Scott's (who had also been let go by the Whalers) process was finding land to build the channel's broadcasting facilities. The Rasmussens first rented office space in Plainville, Connecticut. However, the plan to base ESPN there was put on hold because a local ordinance prohibiting buildings from bearing rooftop satellite dishes. Available land area was quickly found in Bristol, Connecticut (where the channel remains headquartered to this day), with funding to buy the property provided by Getty Oil, which purchased 85% of the company from Bill Rasmussen on February 22, 1979, in an attempt to diversify the company's holdings. This helped the credibility of the fledgling company, however there were still many doubters to the viability of their sports channel concept. Another event that helped build ESPN's credibility was securing an advertising agreement with Anheuser-Busch in the spring of 1979; the company invested $1 million to be the ""exclusive beer advertised on the network.""[5]","ESPN launched on September 7, 1979, beginning with the first telecast of what would become the channel's flagship program, SportsCenter. Taped in front of a small live audience inside the Bristol studios, it was broadcast to 1.4 million cable subscribers throughout the United States.[5]","ESPN's next big break came when the channel acquired the rights to broadcast coverage of the early rounds of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. It first aired the NCAA tournament in March 1980, creating the modern day television event known as ""March Madness"". The channel's tournament coverage also launched the broadcasting career of Dick Vitale, who at the time he joined ESPN, had just been fired as head coach of the Detroit Pistons.","In April of that year, ESPN created another made-for-TV spectacle, when it began televising the NFL Draft. It provided complete coverage of the event that allowed rookie players from the college ranks to begin their professional careers in front of a national television audience in ways they were not able to previously.","The next major stepping stone for ESPN came over the course of a couple of months in 1984. During this time period, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) purchased 100% of ESPN from the Rasmussens and Getty Oil.[5] Under Getty ownership, the channel was unable to compete for the television rights to major sports events contracts as its majority corporate parent would not provide the funding, leading ESPN to lose out for broadcast deals with the National Hockey League (to USA Network) and NCAA Division I college football (to TBS). For years, the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball refused to consider cable as a means of broadcasting some of their games.[6] However, with the backing of ABC, ESPN's ability to compete for major sports contracts greatly increased, and gave it credibility within the sports broadcasting industry.","Later in 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA could no longer monopolize the rights to negotiate the contracts for college football games, allowing each individual school to negotiate broadcast deals of their choice. ESPN took full advantage and began to broadcast a large number of NCAA football games, creating an opportunity for fans to be able to view multiple games each weekend (instead of just one), the same deal that the NCAA had previously negotiated with TBS.[6] ESPN's breakthrough moment occurred in 1987, when it secured a contract with the NFL to broadcast eight games during that year's regular season – all of which aired on Sunday nights, marking the first broadcasts of Sunday NFL primetime games. ESPN's Sunday Night Football games would become the highest-rated NFL telecasts for the next 17 years (before losing the rights to NBC in 2006).[7] The channel's decision to broadcast NFL games on Sunday evenings actually resulted in a decline in viewership for the daytime games shown on the major broadcast networks, marking the first time that ESPN had been a legitimate competitor to NBC and CBS, which had long dominated the sports television market.","In 1992, ESPN launched ESPN Radio, a national sports talk radio network providing analysis and commentary programs (including shows such as Mike and Mike in the Morning and The Herd) as well as audio play-by-play of sporting events (including some simulcasted with the ESPN television channel).[5]","On October 10, 1993, ESPN2 – a secondary channel that originally was programmed with a separate lineup of niche sports popular with males 18–49 years old (with snowboarding and the World Series of Poker as its headliners) as well as serving as an overflow channel for ESPN – launched on cable systems reaching to 10 million subscribers.[5] It became the fastest growing cable channel in the U.S. during the 1990s, eventually expanding its national reach to 75 million subscribers.[5]","Ownership of ABC, and in effect control of ESPN, was acquired first by Capital Cities Communications in 1985, and then by The Walt Disney Company in 1996. In 2012, ESPN generated more revenue for Disney than any of its other properties combined.[8]","On April 26, 2017, Approximately 100 ESPN employees were notified that their position with the sports network had been terminated, among them athletes-turned-analysts Trent Dilfer and Danny Kanell, and noted journalists like NFL beat reporter Ed Werder and Major League Baseball expert Jayson Stark.[9] The layoffs come as ESPN continues to shed viewers, more than 10 million over a period of several years, while forking over big money for the broadcast rights to such properties as the NFL, NBA and College Football Playoff.[10] Further cost-cutting measures taken include moving the studio operations of ESPNU to Bristol from Charlotte, North Carolina,[11] reducing its longtime MLB studio show Baseball Tonight to Sundays as a lead-in to the primetime game and adding the MLB Network-produced Intentional Talk to ESPN2's daily lineup.[12]","Alongside its live sports broadcasts, ESPN also airs a variety of sports highlight, talk, and documentary-styled shows. These include:","Many of ESPN's documentary programs (such as 30 for 30 and Nine for IX) are produced by ESPN Films, a film division created in March 2008 as a restructuring of ESPN Original Entertainment, a programming division that was originally formed in 2001. 30 for 30 started airing in 2009 and continues airing to this day. Each episode is through the eyes of a well known filmmaker and has featured some of the biggest directors in Hollywood.[13] The 30 for 30 film O.J.: Made in America won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2017, the first such Oscar for ESPN.[14]","Since September 2006, ESPN has been integrated with the sports division of sister broadcast network ABC, with sports events televised on that network airing under the banner ESPN on ABC;[15][16] much of ABC's sports coverage since the rebranding has become increasingly limited to secondary coverage of sporting events whose broadcast rights are held by ESPN (such as NBA games, The Open Championship, and the X Games and its related qualifying events) as well as a limited array of event coverage not broadcast on ESPN (most notably, the NBA Finals).","ESPN2 launched on October 1, 1993, originally formatted as a more informal and youth-oriented channel than ESPN aimed at adults between 18 and 34 years of age, carrying a broad mix of event coverage from conventional sports (such as auto racing, college basketball and NHL hockey) to extreme sports (such as BMX, skateboarding and motocross).[24] The ""ESPN BottomLine,"" a ticker displaying sports news and scores during all programming that is now used by all of ESPN's networks, originated on ESPN2 in 1995.[25] In the late 1990s, ESPN2 was gradually reformatted to serve as a secondary outlet for ESPN's mainstream sports programming.[26]","ESPN Classic is a digital cable and satellite television network that launched in 1995 as Classic Sports Network, founded by Brian Bedol and Steve Greenberg. ESPN Inc. purchased Classic Sports Network in 1997 for $175 million,[27] rebranding the channel to its current name the following year. The channel broadcasts notable archived sporting events (originally including events from past decades, but now focusing mainly on events from the 1990s and later), sports documentaries and sports-themed movies.","ESPNews is a digital cable and satellite television network that was launched on November 1, 1996, originally focusing solely on sports news, highlights and press conferences. Since August 2010, the network has gradually incorporated encores of ESPN's various sports debate and entertainment shows and video simulcasts of ESPN Radio shows, in addition to sports news programming (which since the 2013 cancellation of Highlight Express,[28] consists mainly of additional runs of SportsCenter); ESPNews also serves as an overflow feed due to programming conflicts caused by sporting events on the other ESPN networks.","ESPN+ is a digital cable and satellite television network that launched in 2002; this signal is seen in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and from November 21, 2013, also in Venezuela. ESPN+ signal displays events in these sports: Football, Tennis, Rugby, Cycling, Baseball, Horse Riding, Hockey and sports programs about: Football, Tennis, Rugby, Polo, Hockey, Motor, etc. It is divided into two signals: Atlantic and Pacific.","ESPN Deportes (Spanish pronunciation: [i.es.piˈen deˈportes], ""ESPN Sports"") is a digital cable and satellite television network that was originally launched in July 2001 to provide Spanish language simulcasts of certain Major League Baseball telecasts from ESPN. It became a 24-hour sports channel in January 2004.","ESPNU is a digital cable and satellite television network that launched on March 4, 2005, and focuses on college athletics including basketball, football, baseball college swimming, and hockey.","The Longhorn Network is a digital cable and satellite television network that was launched on August 26, 2011, focusing on events from the Texas Longhorns varsity sports teams of the University of Texas at Austin.[29] It features events from the 20 sports sanctioned by the Texas Longhorns athletics department, along with original programming (including historical, academic and cultural content).","SEC Network is a digital cable and satellite television network that launched on August 14, 2014, focusing on the coverage of sporting events sanctioned by the Southeastern Conference. Created as a result of a 20-year broadcast partnership between the two entities, the network is a joint venture between the conference and ESPN Inc. (which operates the network).[30][31]","ESPN, as with Disney/ABC's other broadcast and cable networks, transmits HD programming in the 720p resolution format; this is due to the fact that ABC executives had proposed a progressive scan signal that resolves fluid and high-speed motion in sports better, particularly during slow-motion replays.[33] In 2011, ESPNHD began to downplay its distinct promotional logo in preparation for the conversion of its standard definition feed from a 4:3 full-screen to a letterboxed format (via the application of the AFD #10 display flag), which occurred on June 1 of that year.","ESPN owns and operates regional channels in Australia, Brazil, and Latin America. In Canada, ESPN is a minority owner of The Sports Network (TSN) and the French-language Réseau des sports (RDS). ESPN also has a minority stake in J Sports in Japan. In the United Kingdom, BT Group operates the channel BT Sport ESPN.","ESPN has been a part of popular culture since its inception. Many movies with a general sports theme will include ESPN announcers and programming into their storylines such as in the 2004 comedy DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story, which gently lampoons the channel's multiple outlets by referencing the fictional ESPN8, ""The Ocho"",[38] a reference to a nickname formerly used by ESPN2, ""the Deuce"".","Many jokes have been made by comedians about fake obscure sports that are shown on ESPN. Dennis Miller mentioned watching ""sumo rodeo"", while George Carlin stated that ESPN showed ""Australian dick wrestling"". One of several Saturday Night Live sketches poking fun at the network features a fictional ESPN2 program called Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly, which includes a fake advertisement for ""Senior Women's Beach Lacrosse"". SNL also parodies ESPN Classic with fake archived obscure women's sports event telecasts from the 1980s (such as bowling, weightlifting and curling), with announcers who know nothing about the sport, and instead focus on the sponsors, which were always for feminine hygiene products. In the early years of ESPN, Late Night with David Letterman even featured a ""Top Ten List"" segment poking fun at some of the obscure sports seen on ESPN at the time. One of the more memorable sports on the list was ""Amish Rake Fighting"". A recurring skit on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon named Sports Freak-Out! is a parody of SportsCenter's overexcited anchors.","An occasional joke used in comedic television and film involves people getting ESP (the common abbreviation for extrasensory perception, that was coincidentally the working abbreviation for the channel prior to its launch) confused with ESPN, often including someone saying a sentence along the lines of ""I know these kind of things, I've got ESPN"". Sports video game releases by Electronic Arts in the early 1990s featured a logo for a fictional sports network, EASN (Electronic Arts Sports Network); this was soon changed to EA Sports after ESPN requested that the company stop using the similar name. There are also at least 22 children that are named after the network.[39][40]","Throughout its history, ESPN has received accusations of biased coverage, conflicts of interest, and controversies with individual broadcasters and analysts.[by whom?] ESPN has been criticized for focusing too much on men's college and professional sports, and very little on women's sports. Other criticism has focused on ethnicity in ESPN's varying mediated forms, as well as carriage fees and issues regarding the exportation of ESPN content.[41] Some critics argue that ESPN's success is their ability to provide other enterprise and investigative sports news while competing with other hard sports-news-producing outlets such as Yahoo! Sports and Fox Sports. Some scholars have challenged ESPN's journalistic integrity calling for an expanded standard of professionalism to prevent biased coverage and conflicts of interest.[42]"

Rolling Stone described the record as ""saturated with retro vibes""; its songs ""split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone did last year.""[172]","In 2011, the band performed on the BBC's Children in Need 2011 charity telethon, helping raise over 26 million pounds.[173] In 2012 they extended their involvement with Children in Need as they opened the telecast with a performance of their single ""Live While We're Young"".

Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, ""At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing."" Instead, her original idea was for them to be the ""male equivalent to the Spice Girls"", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style.[193] Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, ""People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [being] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean.""[194] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front,[194] ""For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys – posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows.""[194] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, ""One Direction fulfil a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here"".[195]",Headlining,Opening act,"One Direction has received five BRIT Awards—winning their first with ""What Makes You Beautiful"" for Best British Single at the 2012 BRIT Awards,[198] three NME awards,[199] two Kids' Choice Awards,[200] and four MTV Video Music Awards,[72] among other awards.

The album, released in 2010, was certified gold by the RIAA, despite a generally negative critical response. In March 2010, Lil Wayne began serving an 8-month jail sentence in New York after being convicted of criminal possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in July 2007. Wayne's eighth album I Am Not a Human Being (2010), was released during his incarceration.

Lil Wayne has sold over 100 million records worldwide, including sold more than 15 million albums and 37 million digital tracks in United States, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.[4][5][6]",,,"Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and grew up in the Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana.[7] His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Although Wayne and Birdman have a father–son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. Lil Wayne has also spoken about his deceased stepfather, Rabbit, who he has said he considers his real father. Carter has a tattoo dedicated to Rabbit, who was murdered before Carter became a star.[8] Carter enrolled in the gifted program of Lafayette Elementary School and in the drama club of Eleanor McMain Secondary School.[9] Wayne attended McMain in the early 1990s for two years. He moved to the Marion Abramson Senior High School.[10]","In a CBS interview with Katie Couric, Wayne described why he goes by the name of ""Wayne"" instead of his given name, Dwayne. Carter explained, ""I dropped the D because I'm a junior and my father is living and he's not in my life and he's never been in my life. So I don't want to be Dwayne, I'd rather be Wayne"". Couric asked Wayne if his father knew of this and Wayne replied with a smile, ""He knows now.""[11]","He wrote his first rap song at age eight.[12] In the summer of 1991, he met Bryan Williams, rapper and owner of Cash Money Records. Carter recorded freestyle raps on Williams's answering machine, leading him to mentor the young Carter and include him in Cash Money-distributed songs. He also recorded his first ever collaboration album True Story with rapper B.G.. At the time, Carter was 11, and B.G. was 14, and was billed as ""The B.G.'z"".[13] When he was 12, he played the part of the Tin Man in his middle school drama club's production of The Wiz.[14] At age 12, he accidentally shot himself with a 9 mm handgun, and off-duty police officer Robert Hoobler drove him to the hospital.[15] At McMain Magnet School, Carter was an honors student, but he dropped out at the age of 14 to focus on a musical career.[16]","In 1996, Carter joined the Hot Boys along with rappers Juvenile, B.G., and Turk. At age 15, Carter was the youngest member at the time. Hot Boys' debut album Get It How U Live! was released the same year, followed in 1999 by the group's major-label debut Guerrilla Warfare,[7] which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 5 on the Billboard 200.[17] During their career, the Hot Boys had two charting singles, ""We on Fire"" from Get It How U Live! and ""I Need a Hot Girl"" from Guerrilla Warfare.[18] Carter was also featured on Juvenile's single ""Back That Azz Up"", which reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks.[19] Let 'Em Burn, a compilation album of unreleased tracks recorded during 1999 and 2000, came out in 2003, several years after the group disbanded.[20] It reached No. 3 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 14 on the Billboard 200.[17]","Carter's debut solo album Tha Block Is Hot was released when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys. It debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA.[7] The album earned Carter a 1999 Source magazine nomination for ""Best New Artist"",[21] and also became a Top Ten hit.[7] The lead single was ""Tha Block Is Hot"". After the release of Tha Block is Hot, Carter was featured on the single ""Bling Bling"", with B.G., Juvenile, and Big Tymers. His verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus.","His 2000 follow-up album Lights Out failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut[7] but was certified gold by RIAA.[22] Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys.[23] The lead single was ""Get Off the Corner"", which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style. The second single, which received less attention, was ""Shine"" featuring the Hot Boys. Near the release of Lights Out, Lil Wayne was featured on the single, ""Number One Stunna"" with Big Tymers and Juvenile, which peaked at No. 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.","Lil Wayne's third album 500 Degreez, released in 2002, followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. While being certified gold like its predecessor,[22] it also failed to match the success of his debut.[7] The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez.[24] The lead single was ""Way of Life"" which failed to match the success of his previous singles. After the release of 500 Degreez, Wayne was featured on the single ""Neva Get Enuf"" by 3LW.[25]","In the summer of 2004, Wayne's album Tha Carter was released, marking what critics considered advancement in his rapping style and lyrical themes.[26] In addition, the album's cover art featured the debut of Wayne's now-signature dreadlocks.[7] Tha Carter gained Wayne significant recognition, selling 878,000 copies in the United States, while the single ""Go DJ"" became a Top 5 Hit on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart.[27] After the release of Tha Carter, Lil Wayne was featured in Destiny's Child's single ""Soldier"" with T.I., which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.[28]","Tha Carter II, the follow-up to the original Tha Carter album, was released in December 2005, this time without production by longtime Cash Money Records producer Mannie Fresh, who had since left the label. Tha Carter II sold more than 238,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and went on to sell 2,000,000 copies worldwide. The lead single ""Fireman"" became a hit in the US, peaking at 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Other singles included ""Grown Man"" with Currensy, ""Hustler Musik"", and ""Shooter"" with R&B singer Robin Thicke.

In 2005, Lil Wayne was named president of Cash Money, and in the same year he founded Young Money Entertainment as an imprint of Cash Money.[29] However, as of late 2007, Lil Wayne reported that he has stepped down from the management of both labels and has handed management of Young Money over to Cortez Bryant.[30]","In 2006, Lil Wayne collaborated with rapper Birdman for the album Like Father, Like Son, whose first single ""Stuntin' Like My Daddy"", reached No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100.","Instead of a follow-up solo album, Lil Wayne reached his audience through a plethora of mixtapes and guest appearances on a variety of pop and hip-hop singles.[7] Of his many mixtapes, Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3 received the most media exposure and critical review. Dedication 2, released in 2006, paired Lil Wayne with DJ Drama and contained the acclaimed socially conscious track ""Georgia Bush"", in which Lil Wayne critiqued former US president George W. Bush's response to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the city of New Orleans. Da Drought 3 was released the following year and was available for free legal download.

Rolling Stone described the record as ""saturated with retro vibes""; its songs ""split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone did last year.""[172]","In 2011, the band performed on the BBC's Children in Need 2011 charity telethon, helping raise over 26 million pounds.[173] In 2012 they extended their involvement with Children in Need as they opened the telecast with a performance of their single ""Live While We're Young"". A prominent annual event in British culture, the group said it was ""incredible"" to be involved in Children in Need as it was something that they had ""always watched as children"".[174]","In February 2013, One Direction released ""One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)"" (a medley of ""One Way or Another"" and ""Teenage Kicks"") as the 2013 single for the UK's other major charity telethon Comic Relief.[92] For ITV's Santa charity Christmas campaign, they filmed a set of pleas to their fans and the general public, asking them to donate £2.[175] The band have made numerous other appearances for charitable causes, including the 2011 Pride of Britain Awards where they presented 13-year-old quadruple amputee Danielle Bailey the Child of Courage award at her school assembly, and the 2014 Royal Variety Performance where they played in front of Prince William and Catherine at the London Palladium.[176][177]","In September 2012, Niall Horan organised an event to raise money for Irish Autism Action and another charity, called Temporary Emergency Accommodation Mullingar, based in his hometown. Due to overwhelming demand to participate in the fundraising, the ticket website for the event broke down. Horan's brother Greg commented on the website crash, saying that ""there were 500 tickets and they were all snapped up pretty quick"".[178]","In 2013, band members Liam Payne and Harry Styles partnered with Trekstock, a leading cancer charity to help raise money for cancer research.[179] As ambassadors of the charity, the duo collaborated to offer the chance for one fan and a friend to win an evening out with them in return for a donation to the charity as part of an exclusive ""#HangwithLiam&Harry"" global campaign. They had originally set a goal of raising $500,000 and ended up raising $784,984. Trekstock later added that this amount would allow them to ""complete funding of their Hodgkin's lymphoma trial, in the hope of offering a much brighter future to thousands of children and young people affected by this form of disease."" One Direction were named the most charitable in 2013 behind Taylor Swift by social change organisation DoSomething.org.[180]","In 2014, One Direction donated £600,000 for the Stand up to Cancer campaign by giving portions of their ticket sales revenues from their Where We Are Tour.[181] On 15 November 2014, One Direction joined the charity group Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa.[182]","Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, in an article on One Direction's success in North America, notes that Americans had left a gap in the market and it took the prominence of Justin Bieber to demonstrate that there still was a market for ""clean cut, wholesome, whiter-than-white, middle class parent friendly pop: cute boys advocating puppy love. And what could be better than one cute boy, if not five?""[183] One Direction have been described as sparking a resurgence in the interest in boy bands, and as forming part of a new ""British Invasion"" in the United States.[184][185][186][187][188][189] Bill Werde, a representative of Billboard magazine, commented, ""There's a lot of possibility here, there's a lot of upside, that level of talent with those kinds of looks, it's really a perfect storm for a massive, massive successful phenomenon.""[190]","Sonny Takhar, the chief executive officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media. ""Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here – it's the act,"" he said. ""It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before.""[190] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, ""These guys live online, and so do their fans.""[189] Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, ""which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans,"" according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian.[190] One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day.[191] In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is ""the cute one"", Malik is ""the quiet and mysterious one"", Payne is ""the sensible one"", Styles is ""the charming one"" and Tomlinson is ""the funny one"".[192] Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, ""At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing."" Instead, her original idea was for them to be the ""male equivalent to the Spice Girls"", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style.[193] Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, ""People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [being] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean.""[194] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front,[194] ""For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys – posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows.""[194] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, ""One Direction fulfil a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here"".[195]",Headlining,Opening act,"One Direction has received five BRIT Awards—winning their first with ""What Makes You Beautiful"" for Best British Single at the 2012 BRIT Awards,[198] three NME awards,[199] two Kids' Choice Awards,[200] and four MTV Video Music Awards,[72] among other awards. One Direction won 27 awards from 29 they have been nominated for at the Teen Choice Awards.[201] One Direction also won two American Music Awards out of their two nominations for Favorite Pop/Rock Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group, respectively."

His second album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), peaked at number one in the United States. The album spawned the international singles ""Locked Out of Heaven"", ""When I Was Your Man"" and ""Treasure"". In 2014, Mars lent his vocals to Mark Ronson's ""Uptown Funk"". In 2016, he released his third studio album 24K Magic with the lead single of the same title released on October 7, 2016. To date, he has sold over 115 million singles and 9 million albums worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. Mars has landed seven number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 since his career launched in 2010, attaining his first five faster than any male artist since Elvis Presley.","Mars has received many awards and nominations, including five Grammy Awards, and was named one of Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011. In December 2013, he ranked number one on the Forbes 30 under 30 list. Mars is known for his stage performances and retro showmanship. He is accompanied by his band, The Hooligans, who play a variety of instruments such as electric guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, drums and horns, and also serve as backup singers and dancers. Mars performs in a wide range of musical styles.",,,"Peter Gene Hernandez was born on October 8, 1985,[1] in Honolulu, Hawaii to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette San Pedro Bayot, and was raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu.[2]","His father is of half Puerto Rican and half Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Ukraine and Hungary), and is originally from Brooklyn, New York.[3][4][5] His mother emigrated from the Philippines to Hawaii as a child, and was of Filipino, and some Spanish, ancestry.[4][6] His parents met while performing in a show in which his mother was a hula dancer and his father played percussion.[5] At the age of two, he was nicknamed ""Bruno"" by his father, because of his resemblance to professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino.[7][8][9]","Mars is one of six children and came from a musical family which exposed him to a diverse mix of genres including: reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&B.[10][11] His mother was both a singer and a dancer, and his father performed Little Richard rock and roll music.[12] Mars' uncle was an Elvis impersonator, and also encouraged three-year-old Mars to perform on stage. Mars performed songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations.[8] At age four, Mars began performing five days a week with his family's band, The Love Notes, and became known on the island for his impersonation of Presley.[13] In 1990, Mars was featured in MidWeek as ""Little Elvis"", and later appeared in a cameo role in the film Honeymoon in Vegas (1992),[8][14] and performed in the halftime show of the 1990 Aloha Bowl.[15]","The time Mars spent impersonating Presley had a major impact on his musical evolution and performing techniques.[16] He later began playing guitar after being inspired by Jimi Hendrix.[17] In 2010, he also acknowledged his Hawaiian roots and musical family as an influence, explaining: ""Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments...I've just been surrounded by it.""[18] When he attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School he performed in a group called The School Boys.[19] In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career.[8][14] He adopted his stage name from the nickname his father gave him, adding ""Mars"" at the end because: ""I felt like I didn't have [any] pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I’m out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars.""[20] Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also due to ""the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latino artist, and even convinced him to sing in Spanish.""[21]","""I'd always been a working musician in Hawaii and never had problems paying rent. And then it's like, 'Now I'm in L.A. and my phone's getting shut off.' That's when reality hit. I started DJ-ing. It was something silly. I told this person I could DJ because they said they could pay me $75 cash under the table. I didn't know how to DJ. I lost that job pretty quick.""","Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Mars signed with Motown Records in 2004, in a deal that ""went nowhere"", and had a conversation with Will.i.am's management which turned out to be fruitless.[23][21] However, Mars' experience with Motown proved to be beneficial to his career when he met songwriter and producer Philip Lawrence, who was also signed to the label.[23]","After Mars was dropped by the label less than a year of being signed, he stayed in Los Angeles and landed a music publishing deal in 2005 with Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent.[24][25]","""Bruno came to the conclusion that the best way to further his career was writing and producing hit songs.""","Lindsey showed Jeff Bhasker and Mars the ins and outs of writing pop music, and acted as a mentor helping him to hone his craft. Bhasker, met Mars through Mike Lynn (the A&R at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment who first heard Mars' demo tape through his sister and flew him to LA), who explained: ""He’d mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, because you can have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline.""[24][25][26] Mars played cover songs around Los Angeles in a band with Bhasker and Eric Hernandez, (Mars' brother), who is now The Hooligans' drummer.[27]","When Lawrence was first told he should meet Mars he was reluctant to do so since he did not even have money for bus fare. Keith Harris, drummer for The Black Eyed Peas, told him: ""Whatever it costs you to get out here, I'll reimburse you."" Lawrence responded: ""Just give me five dollars back for the bus.""[28] The pair began collaborating, writing songs for Mars, but they received many rejections from labels. On the verge of giving up, they received a call from Brandon Creed, who was looking for songs for a reunited Menudo. He liked their song ""Lost"", which was written for Mars. The duo did not want to give the song away, but when they were offered $20,000 for it they agreed. The sale of this song allowed them to continue working,[28] and Mars and Lawrence decided that they would write and produce songs together for other artists.[25]","In 2006, Lawrence introduced Mars to his future A&R manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck.[29] After hearing him play a couple of songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label,[29] because they felt it was too early and that he still needed to develop as an artist.[30]","Before becoming a successful solo artist, Mars was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, Sean Kingston, and Flo Rida.[10][22] He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song ""Get Sexy"" and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7.[31] His first recorded appearance as a singer was on Far East Movement's second studio album Animal, on the track ""3D"".[32] He was also featured on pastor and hip hop artist Jaeson Ma's debut single ""Love"" in August 2009.[33][34] He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on, and co-writing, B.o.B's ""Nothin' on You"" and Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire""; both songs peaked within the top ten on many charts worldwide.[35][36][37][38]","He said of them: ""I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of ""Nothin' on You"", it might've sounded like some '90s R&B."" Following this success, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010.[39] The EP peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200 and a music video was released for the song ""The Other Side"" featuring singers Cee Lo Green and B.o.B.[40][41] Mars collaborated with Green once more in August 2010 composing his single ""Fuck You"" with The Smeezingtons.[42]","After serving as guest vocalist on B.o.B's and Travies McCoy's singles,[38] Mars released ""Just the Way You Are"" on July 19, 2010.[43] The song was the lead single from his debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as several other charts worldwide, in September.[44][45] The song holds the record as the longest-reigning debut format hit, spending twenty weeks atop Adult Contemporary.[46] He also released two digital singles—""Liquor Store Blues"" featuring Damian Marley, and ""Grenade"" to promote the album,[47][48]—before confirming ""Grenade"" as the album's second single on October 21, 2010.[49] ""Grenade"" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in December[50] and was also successful on other international charts.[51] Released digitally on October 4, and physically on October 5, 2010,[47][52] the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling 55,000 copies.[53] It received generally positive reviews from music critics,[54] and has since sold six million copies worldwide.[55] In February 2011, ""The Lazy Song"" was released as the album's third single[56] becoming the album's third consecutive top five on the Hot 100, peaking at number four on October 23, 2011.[57]","""Marry You"" followed as the fourth single from Doo-Wops & Hooligans on August 22, 2011.[58] Although it was not released as a single in the United States, it peaked at number 85 on the Hot 100 on January 15, 2011, thanks to strong digital sales.[59] Since then it has sold 2.2 million digital copies.[60] In November, ""Count On Me"" was released as the album's fifth single in Australia and New Zealand.[61] Additionally, it was announced on Mars' website, that he recorded and co-wrote a new song titled ""It Will Rain"" for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.[62] The song was released for purchase on iTunes on September 27, 2011.[63] It peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100.[59] During this period, he appeared on a number of collaborative singles, including ""Lighters"", a duet with Bad Meets Evil released on July 5, 2011,[64] ""Mirror"", released on September 13, 2011,[65] with Lil Wayne, and ""Young, Wild & Free"" with Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg from the Mac & Devin Go to High School soundtrack, which was available for purchase on October 11, 2011.[66] The songs peaked at number four, sixteen and seven on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively.[67][68]","On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Casino for possession of cocaine.[21][69] While talking to a police officer, Mars reportedly declared that what he did was ""foolish"" and that ""he has never used drugs before.""[70][71] Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year. He paid a $2,000 fine, did 200 hours of community service, and completed a drug counseling course.[72] Nevertheless, in a cover story for GQ magazine in 2013, Mars said ""I was young, man! I was in f---ing Vegas...I wasn't thinking"", he added: ""I was given a number one record and I'm out doing dumb sh--."" Mars confessed that he lied to the authorities about having done cocaine before, saying ""I don't know where that came from"", adding: ""I was really intoxicated. I was really drunk. So a lot of that is a big blur, and I try every day to forget and keep pushing.""[21]","He opened for Maroon 5 on the fall leg of their Hands All Over Tour starting October 6, 2010, and co-headlined with McCoy on a European tour starting October 18, 2010.[47] From November 16, 2010,[73] to January 28, 2012,[74] Mars was on The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, in support of the album.[75]","On February 13, 2011, Mars won his first Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, having received six nominations: Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for ""Nothin' on You"", Record of the Year for ""Nothin' on You"" and ""Fuck You"", Song of the Year for ""Fuck You"", and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical at the 53rd Grammy Awards.[76][77] At the 54th Grammy Awards, Mars was nominated in six categories: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Doo-Wops & Hooligans, Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for ""Grenade"", and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical.

[148] Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: ""In Hawaii some of the biggest radio stations are reggae.

The song comes first.""[5]","Philip Lawrence, one of his music partners from The Smeezingtons, stated: ""What people don't know is there's a darker underbelly to Bruno Mars.""

During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[102] When asked if he used the tax code to avoid paying taxes, he said, ""Of course I did. Of course I did."" He then went on to say he paid ""hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes"", calling it a ""simple"" thing. ""I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too"", he said.[103][104][105]","On March 14, 2017 the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow show. The two pages showed that Trump paid $38 million in federal taxes and had a gross adjusted income of $150 million.[106][107] The White House confirmed the authenticity of the 2005 documents and stated: ""Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.""[106][107]","Trump started his career at his father's real estate development company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which focused on middle-class rental housing in the New York City boroughs outside Manhattan, but also had business elsewhere.[108] For example, during his undergraduate study, Trump joined his father Fred in successfully revitalizing the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, thereby boosting the occupancy rate from 66% to 100%.[109][110]","Trump was promoted to president of the company in 1971 (while his father became chairman of the board), and renamed it The Trump Organization.[111][112] In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended that the organization systematically discriminated against African Americans wishing to rent apartments, rather than merely screening out people based on low income, as the Trumps stated. Under an agreement reached in 1975, the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and made the Urban League an intermediary for qualified minority applicants.[113][114] His adviser and attorney during (and after) that period was Roy Cohn, who responded to attacks by counterattacking with maximum force, and who valued both positive and negative publicity, which were attitudes that Trump appreciated.[115]","In 1978, Trump consummated his first major real estate deal in Manhattan, purchasing a half-share in the decrepit Commodore Hotel, largely funded by a $70 million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain. Designed by architect Der Scutt, the project was able to proceed by leveraging competing interests and by taking advantage of tax breaks.[116] After remodeling, the hotel reopened as the Grand Hyatt Hotel, located next to Grand Central Terminal.[117][118]","Also in 1978, Trump finished negotiations to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 202-meter (663-foot) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, which The New York Times attributed to his ""persistence"" and ""skills as a negotiator"".[119] To make way for the new building, a crew of undocumented Polish workers demolished an old Bonwit Teller store including art deco features that had initially been marked for preservation.[120] The building was completed in 1983, and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[121][122] Architectural critic Paul Goldberger said in 1983 that he was surprised to find the tower's atrium was ""the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years"".[123][124] Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show The Apprentice, and includes a fully functional television studio set.[125]","Repairs on the Wollman Rink (originally opened in 1949 in Central Park) were started in 1980 by a general contractor unconnected to Trump. Despite an expected  2 1⁄2-year construction schedule, the repairs were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $775,000 less than the initial budget of $1.95 million, and operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink's concession rights.[126]","Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan in 1988 for $400 million, and asked his then-wife Ivana to manage its operation.[127] The hotel was built in 1907, and Trump called it ""the ultimate work of art"", spending $50 million on its restoration.[128] According to hotel expert Thomas McConnell, the Trumps boosted it from a three-star to a four-star ranking, and sold it in 1995, by which time Ivana was no longer involved.[129]","In 1994, Trump became involved with the building on Columbus Circle later called Trump International Hotel and Tower, which was swaying in the wind, and he began a reconstruction project that stopped the swaying and gave the building a full makeover.[130][131] Trump thereafter owned commercial space in that 44-story mixed-use (hotel and condominium) tower.[132] In 1996, he acquired a vacant seventy-story skyscraper on Wall Street which had briefly been the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1930. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street.[133]","In 1997, he began construction on Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River, and encountered delays the following year because a subcontracter had to replace defective concrete.[134][135] Ultimately, he and the other investors in that project sold their interest in 2005 for $1.8 billion, in what was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City.[136]","From 1994 to 2002, Trump owned a 50% share of the Empire State Building. He would have renamed it to ""Trump Empire State Building Tower Apartments"" if he had been able to boost his share.[137][138]","In 2001, across from the headquarters of the United Nations, he completed Trump World Tower, which for a while was the tallest all-residential tower in the world.[139] Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico in Manhattan in 2002, which re-opened with 35 stories of luxury condominiums in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue.[140] Meanwhile, he continued to own millions of square feet of other prime Manhattan real estate.[141]","Trump acquired the historic Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida in 1985 for $5 million, plus $3 million for the home's furnishings. It was built in the 1920s by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, who envisioned the house as a future winter retreat for American presidents.","Trump's initial offer of $28 million had been rejected, and he was able to get the property at the much lower price by purchasing separate beachfront property and threatening to build a house on it that would block Mar-a-Lago's ocean view. In addition to using the estate as a home, Trump also turned it into a private club open to everyone who could afford the initiation fee of $100,000 plus annual dues.[142]","In 1986, he acquired a foreclosed, 33-story, twin-tower condominium complex in nearby West Palm Beach for $40 million, with automobile manufacturing executive Lee Iacocca investing in three of the condos.[143] Despite sprucing up its public areas, and years of heavy promotion, selling the units proved difficult, and the deal turned out to be unprofitable.[144]","New Jersey legalized gambling in 1977, and the following year Trump was in Atlantic City, New Jersey to explore how he might get involved. Seven years later, Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino opened there, built by Trump with financing from Holiday Corporation which also was managing that business.[145] Renamed ""Trump Plaza"" soon after opening, it was then the tallest building in Atlantic City.[146] The casino's poor results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp., which led to Trump paying $70 million in May 1986 to buy out their interest in the property.[147][148] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million; when completed in 1985, that hotel and casino became Trump Castle, and Trump's wife, Ivana, managed that property until Trump transferred her in 1988 to run the Trump Plaza Hotel in New York.[149][150]","Also in 1988, Trump acquired his third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal then halfway through construction, by making a complex transaction with the television host and entertainer Merv Griffin as well as the resort and casino company Resorts International.[151] In October 1989, three of his top Atlantic City executives died in a helicopter accident, which both stymied and delayed the planned opening of the Taj Mahal.[152] The Taj finally opened in April 1990, and was built at a total cost of $1.1 billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever.[153][154] Financed with $675 million in junk bonds,[155] it was a major gamble by Trump.[156] The project underwent debt restructuring the following year,[157] leaving Trump with 50% ownership.[158] He also sold his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[159][160]","Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR) in 1995, which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[161] THCR purchased Taj Mahal in 1996, and underwent bankruptcy restructuring in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[162] He served as chairman of the publicly-traded THCR organization, which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 until early 2009, and served as CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2005.[163]","During the 1990s, Trump's casino ventures faced competition from Native American gaming at the Foxwoods casino located on an Indian reservation in Connecticut (where it was exempt from the state's anti-gambling laws). Trump stated in 1993 that the casino owners did not look like real Indians to him or to other Indians.[164][165] Subsequent to that well-publicized remark about the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, Trump became a key investor backing the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots who were also seeking state recognition.[166]","As of 2016, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 3,500 state and federal legal actions. He or one of his companies was the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump's side won 451 times and lost 38.[167][168]","Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[169][170] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, ""I do play with the bankruptcy laws – they're very good for me"" as a tool for trimming debt.[171][172]","The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[173][174] Trump said, ""I've used the laws of this country to pare debt ... We'll have the company. We'll throw it into a chapter. We'll negotiate with the banks. We'll make a fantastic deal. You know, it's like on The Apprentice. It's not personal. It's just business.""[157]","A 2016 analysis of Trump's business career by The Economist concluded that his ""… performance [from 1985 to 2016] has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York"", noting both his successes and bankruptcies.[175] A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that ""Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success"", calling his casino bankruptcies the ""most infamous flop"" of his business career.[176]","The Trump Organization operates many golf courses and resorts in the United States and around the world. According to Golfweek, Trump owns or manages about 18 golf courses.[177] His personal financial disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission stated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382 million,[77][87] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[89]","In 2006, Trump bought 1,400 acres (570 ha) including the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland and created a golf resort there.[178] Scottish supporters emphasized potential economic benefits, and opponents emphasized potential environmental harm to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).[179][180][181] A spokesperson for the golf course has said 95% of the SSSI is untouched.[182] A 2011 independent documentary, You've Been Trumped, chronicled the golf resort's construction and struggles.[183] In 2015, an offshore windfarm being built within sight of the golf course prompted a legal challenge by Trump, which was dismissed by the U.K. Supreme Court.[184] In the wake of the 2008 recession, Trump greatly scaled back development of this property, and as of December 2016 Scottish officials were pushing for completion of the far larger development as originally approved.[185]","In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which hosted the Open Championship four times between 1977 and 2009.[186][187] After extensive renovations and a remodeling of the course by golf architect Martin Ebert, Turnberry was re-opened in June 2016.[188]","Trump pursued business deals in Russia starting in 1987, and in 1996 filed trademark applications for potential Russian real estate development deals, but none of those deals ever materialized.[189][190] Along with his partners and children, Trump visited Moscow several times, connecting with developers and government officials to explore joint venture opportunities that never panned out.[191][192][193][194]","Outside Russia, several of Trump's real estate developments received a large part of their financing from private Russian investors. In 2008 his son Donald Trump Jr. said ""Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets"" and ""we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.""[195][189][196] Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, in partnership with Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, and his Russia ties came under intense investigative reporting during and after the 2016 presidential campaign.[191][193]","In the late 2000s and early 2010s, The Trump Organization expanded its footprint in the United States beyond New York and into a few other countries, with the co-development and management of hotel towers in Chicago, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Panama City, Toronto, and Vancouver. Internationally, as of January 2017, there were also Trump-owned or -branded buildings in Istanbul, Seoul, Manila, Mumbai, and Uruguay.[197]","When Trump was elected president in November 2016, questions arose over how he would avoid conflicts of interest between his work in the White House and his business activities. At a press conference on January 10, 2017, Trump said that he and his daughter Ivanka would resign all roles with The Trump Organization, while his two oldest sons Don Jr. and Eric would run the business, together with Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg.[198]","Trump retained his financial stake in the business.[199] His attorney Sherri Dillon said that before the January 20 inauguration, Trump would put those business assets into a trust, which would hire an ethics advisor and a compliance counsel. She added that the Trump Organization would not pursue any new foreign business deals, while continuing to pursue domestic opportunities.[200] As of April 2017, Trump companies owned more than 400 condo units and home lots in the United States, valued at $250 million in total ($200,000 to $35 million each).[201]","After Trump took charge of the family real estate firm in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization, he not only greatly expanded its real estate operations, but also ventured into numerous other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[202]","In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals—an American Football team that played in the United States Football League—from oil magnate J. Walter Duncan. The USFL played its first three seasons during the spring and summer, but Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL's 1986 schedule to the fall. He argued that the new schedule would coincide with the National Football League and would eventually force a merger with the NFL, thereby significantly increasing their investment.[203]","After the 1985 season, the Generals merged with the Houston Gamblers, but the organization experienced continuous financial difficulties. The USFL was down to just seven active franchises from a high of eighteen and was soon forced to fold, despite winning an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.[204]","Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded, operating golf courses in several countries.[204] He also hosted several boxing matches in Atlantic City at the Trump Plaza, including Mike Tyson's 1988 fight against Michael Spinks, and at one time, acted as a financial advisor to Tyson.[204][205][206]","In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia. The inaugural race was controversial, and Trump withdrew his sponsorship after the second Tour de Trump in 1990, because his other business ventures were experiencing financial woes. The race continued for several more years as the Tour DuPont.[207][208]","Trump submitted a stalking-horse bid on the Buffalo Bills when it came up for sale following Ralph Wilson's death in 2014; he was ultimately outbid, as he expected, and Kim and Terrence Pegula won the auction.[209] During his 2016 presidential run, he was critical of the NFL's updated concussion rules, complaining on the campaign trail that the game has been made ""soft"" and ""weak"", saying a concussion is just ""a ding on the head."" He accused referees of throwing penalty flags needlessly just to be seen on television ""so their wives see them at home.""[210]","From 1996 until 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe pageants, which were founded in 1952.[211][212] The Miss Universe Pageants include Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, and his management of this business involved his family-members; for example, daughter Ivanka once hosted Miss Teen USA. Trump hired the first female president of the Miss Universe business in 1997.[213] He became dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled the pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[214][215]","In 2015, NBC and Univision both ended their business relationships with the Miss Universe Organization after Trump's controversial 2015 presidential campaign remarks about Mexican illegal immigrants.[216][217] Trump subsequently filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision, alleging a breach of contract and defamation.[218][219] The lawsuit was settled in February 2016, but terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[220] On September 11, 2015, Trump announced that he had become the sole owner of the Miss Universe Organization by purchasing NBC's stake.[221][222] He sold his own interests in the pageant shortly afterwards to WME/IMG.[211]","In 1999, a few years after buying into Miss Universe, Trump founded a modeling company, Trump Model Management, which operates in the SoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.[223] Together with another Trump company, Trump Management Group LLC, Trump Model Management has brought hundreds of foreign fashion models into the United States to work in the fashion industry since 2000.[224] This business and the beauty pageants overlapped somewhat, with various pageant contestants getting modelling contracts.[225]","Trump University LLC was an American for-profit education company that ran a real estate training program from 2005 until at least 2010.[226] After multiple lawsuits, the business is now defunct. It was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny, and offered courses, charging between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[227][228] In 2005 the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word ""university"" violated state law, and after a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the ""Trump Entrepreneurial Institute"".[229] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[230]","In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit alleging that Trump University made false statements and defrauded consumers.[229][231] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies.[232] During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel who oversaw those two cases, alleging bias because of his Mexican heritage.[233][234][235] Trump later said that his concerns about Curiel's impartiality were not based upon ethnicity alone, but also upon rulings in the case.[236][237]","The Low v. Trump case was set for trial on November 28, 2016 in San Diego.[238] Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases. In the settlement, Trump did not admit to any wrongdoing but agreed to pay a total of $25 million.[239][240] The litigants agreed to the settlement just an hour before a hearing regarding Trump's latest request to delay the trial until after the inauguration. Jason Forge, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said he ""definitely detected a change of tone and change of approach"" from the Trump representatives after the election.[241] The settlement was called into question on March 6, 2017, when Sherri Simpson, a Florida bankruptcy lawyer and former Trump University student, filed an objection.[242]","Trump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies, as well as licensing his name for various commercial products and services. In doing so, he achieved mixed success for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[243] In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3 billion.[244]","Because developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects, some buildings that display his name are not owned or operated by him.[245] According to Forbes, this portion of Trump's empire, run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562 million valuation, with 33 licensing projects under development including seven Trump International Hotel and Tower ""condo hotels"".","Properties to which Trump has licensed his name and image include two in Florida that have gone into foreclosure.[246] The Turkish owner of Trump Towers Istanbul, who pays Trump for the use of his name, was reported in December 2015 to be exploring legal means to dissociate the property after the candidate's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[247]","The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation[248] established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal by Trump and Tony Schwartz.[249][250] The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump,[251] who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[251]","The foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[252] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York–Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[253][254] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[251] Linda McMahon later became Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[255]","In 2016, investigations by The Washington Post uncovered several potential legal and ethical violations conducted by the charity, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[256] After beginning an investigation into the foundation, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that it was allegedly in violation of New York laws regarding charities, and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[257][258][259] A Trump spokesman called the investigation a ""partisan hit job"".[257] In response to mounting complaints, Trump's team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove ""even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President.""[260]","Trump has twice been nominated for an Emmy Award and has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series.[261] He has also played an oil tycoon in The Little Rascals,[262] and had a singing role at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2006.[263] Trump is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and receives an annual pension of more than $110,000.[264][265] He has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists.

Contestants were successively ""fired"" and eliminated from the game. For the first year of the show, Trump earned $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show's initial success, he was paid $1 million per episode.[270] In a July 2015 press release, Trump's campaign manager said that NBCUniversal had paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons hosting the show,[78] although the network did not verify the statement.[271] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television on The Apprentice.[243][272]","Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump was hired as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities.

He said that ""instead of asking for money"", General Motors ""should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal.""[288]","Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, and a Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders; he was one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.[289] A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of incumbent president Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States.[290] A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run.[291][292] His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[293][294][295]","Trump played a leading role in ""birther"" conspiracy theories that had been circulating since President Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.[296][297] Beginning in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Obama's citizenship and eligibility to serve as President.[298][299][300] Although the Obama campaign had released a copy of the short-form birth certificate in 2008,[301] Trump demanded to see the original ""long-form"" certificate.[298] He mentioned having sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings.[298] He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama's grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya.[302][303] When the White House later released Obama's long-form birth certificate,[304] Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying ""I hope it checks out.""[305] His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama's hand,[306] and he has defended his pursuit of the issue when prompted, later saying that his promotion of the conspiracy made him ""very popular"".[307] In 2011, Trump had called for Obama to release his student records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school.[308] When asked in 2015 whether he believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he did not want to discuss the matter further.[309][310] In September 2016, Trump publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S., and said that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.[299][311][312]","Trump made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. His appearance at CPAC was organized by GOProud, an LGBT conservative organization, in conjunction with GOProud supporter Roger Stone, who was close with Trump. GOProud pushed for a write-in campaign for Trump at CPAC's presidential straw poll. The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[313][314] Christopher R. Barron, co-founder of GOProud, would later endorse Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and launch ""LGBT for Trump"", a political campaign with the goal of encouraging lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people to support Trump.[315]","In the 2012 Republican primaries, Trump generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible candidates.[316] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have become the President of the United States, had he ran.[293]","In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[317] During the lightly attended early-morning speech, Trump spoke out against illegal immigration, then-President Obama's ""unprecedented media protection"", and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.[318][319]","Additionally, Trump spent over $1 million in 2013 to research a possible run for president of the United States.[320] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. In response to the memo, Trump said that while New York had problems and that its taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him.[321] In January 2014, Trump made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community.[322] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[323] In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice, as he mulled his political future.[324]","In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000.[325][326] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[327] Trump eventually dropped out of the race due to party infighting, but still won the party's California and Michigan primaries after doing so.[328][329][330]","Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times over the years. Trump was a Democrat prior to 1987.[331] In 1987, Trump registered as a Republican in Manhattan.[332]","In 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001, ostensibly due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[325]","From 2001 to 2008, Trump identified as a Democrat, but in 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for President. In 2009, he officially changed his party registration to Republican.[333] In December 2011, Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he later pledged to stay.[334][335]","Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans.[336] After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats.[337] In February 2012, Trump openly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for President.[338] When asked in 2015 which recent president he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes.[339][340]","According to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980s—although no laws were broken—by donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name.[341][342] Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to gain favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends.[341][343]","On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in Manhattan. In the speech, Trump drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"".[344]","In his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness; he also stated that the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[345][346][347] In part due to his fame, Trump received an unprecedented amount of unpaid coverage from the media during his run for the presidency; this elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[348]",Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan were hesitant to support him during his early quest for the presidency. They doubted his chances of winning the general election and feared that he could harm the image of the Republican Party.[349][350],"The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy,[351] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[352][353] The connection of this group to the Trump campaign is controversial; writers such as Jon Ronson have suggested that the link between Trump and right-wing figures such as Alex Jones and Roger Stone is a marriage of convenience.[354]","During the campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white nationalists,[355] especially in his initial refusal to condemn the support of David Duke, a former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, in a CNN interview with Jake Tapper. He had previously criticized Duke in 1991, disavowed the 2000 Reform Party due to the support of Duke and others, and condemned Duke on the campaign trail both before and after the interview.[356] In August, he appointed Steve Bannon—the executive chairman of Breitbart News—as his campaign CEO; the website was described by Bannon as ""the platform for the alt-right.""[357] However, Bannon later told the Wall Street Journal that he was an ""economic nationalist"" but not ""a supporter of ethno-nationalism.""[358]","Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on protesters inside the rallies, and clashes between protesters and Trump supporters outside the venues.[359][360][361]","Fact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[362][363][364] At least four major publications – Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times – have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements.[365] Trump's penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds. Trump has called his public speaking ""truthful hyperbole"", though online media outlets such as Yahoo! believed Trump's ""truthful hyperbole"" to be a political tactic.[366][367] Lucas Graves, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Journalism & Mass Communication,[368] opined, of Trump's speaking, that Trump ""often speaks in a suggestive way that makes it unclear what exactly he meant, so that fact-checkers ""have to be really careful when you pick claims to check to pick things ... that reflect what the speaker was clearly trying to communicate.""[369] Other sources, such as NPR, also said that Trump's statements during the campaign were often opaque or suggestive.[370]","Trump entered a field of 16 candidates who were vying for the 2016 Republican nomination; this was the largest presidential field in American history.[371] Trump participated in eleven of the twelve Republican debates, skipping only the seventh debate on January 28 (that was the last debate before primary voting began on February 1). The debates received historically high television ratings, which increased the visibility of Trump's campaign.[372]","By early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.[373] On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote and remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination.[374] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016, which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[375] With nearly 14 million votes, Trump broke the all-time record for winning the most primary votes in the history of the Republican Party. He also set the record for the largest number of votes against the front runner.[376]","After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump's focus shifted to the general election, urging remaining primary voters to ""save [their] vote for the general election.""[377] Trump began targeting Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country. One month before the Republican National Convention, Secret Service agents thwarted an assassination attempt on Trump during one of his rallies in Las Vegas; they seized a 20-year-old British man who was illegally residing in the U.S.[378]","Clinton had established a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[379][380][381] In reference to the matter, FBI Director James Comey opined Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified government material.[382]","On July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[383] Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party on July 19, 2016, at the Republican National Convention.[384] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole, but the other prior nominees did not attend, though John McCain endorsed Trump prior to the convention.[385][386]","Two days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech inspired by Richard Nixon's 1968 acceptance speech.[387] The historically long speech was watched by nearly 35 million people and received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.[388][389][390]","In late July, Trump came close to Clinton in national polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the small side by historical standards.[391] Following Clinton's 7 percent convention bounce, she significantly extended her lead over Trump in national polls at the start of August.[392][393]","On September 26, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off in the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Lester Holt, an anchor with NBC News, was the moderator.[394] This was the most watched presidential debate in United States history.[395] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning narrative of that debate was dominated by a leaked tape of Trump making lewd comments, and counter-accusations by Trump of sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton. Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference prior to the debate. The final presidential debate was held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on October 19. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular press attention.[396][397]","Trump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS or IS).","Media have described Trump's political positions as ""populist"",[398][399] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[400] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[401] usually considered a liberal (Democratic Party) policy.[402][403] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a ""fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views"", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[404][405]","Trump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[406][407][408] Politico has described his positions as ""eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory"",[408] while NBC News counted ""141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues"" during his campaign.[409]","There has been intensive media scrutiny of Trump's relationship to Russia.[410][411] During the campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[412] Several of Trump's advisers, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and former campaign manager Paul Manafort, have been connected to Russian or Ukrainian officials.[195][413] The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine released information that helped to force Manafort's resignation as campaign manager.[414] American intelligence sources stated with ""high confidence"" that the Russian government attempted to intervene in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump by hacking into computers of Trumps' opponents,[415] and that members of Trump's campaign were in contact with Russian government officials both before and after the presidential election.[416]","Two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced, made on a studio bus while preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. On the tape, Trump is heard bragging to the show's then-cohost Billy Bush about forcibly kissing and groping women.[417][418][419] ""I just start kissing them,"" he says, ""I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything ... grab them by the pussy.""[420] During the recording, Trump also speaks of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he ""moved on her very heavily.""[420] These statements were recorded several months after Trump married his third and current wife, Melania, who was pregnant at the time.[420][421]","Trump's language on the tape was described by the media as ""vulgar"", ""sexist"", and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign,[422][423] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[424][425] with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race.[426] A number of Trump supporters worldwide also withdrew their support following release of the tape, including many Conservatives in Britain.[427] Subsequently, at least 15 women[428] came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.[429][430]","Trump and his campaign have denied all of the sexual misconduct accusations, which Trump has called ""false smears"", and alleged a conspiracy against him.[431][432][433] In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump responded by alleging that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, had ""abused women"" and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims.[434]","On Election Day, November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232 votes. The counts were later adjusted to 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides, formalizing Trump's election to the presidency.[435] In the early hours of November 9, Clinton called Trump to concede the election. Trump then delivered his victory speech before hundreds of supporters in the New York Hilton hotel. The speech was in contrast with some of his previous rhetoric, with Trump promising to heal the division caused by the election, thanking Clinton for her service to the country, and promising to be a president to all Americans.[436][437]","Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, making him the fifth person to be elected president after losing the popular vote. Records on this matter date from the year 1824.[438][nb 1] Clinton finished ahead by 2.86 million votes or 2.1 percentage points, 48.04% to 45.95%, with neither candidate reaching a majority nationwide.[441][442]","Trump's victory was considered a stunning political upset, as polls consistently showed Hillary Clinton leading nationwide (where she did win) and in most battleground states, while Trump's support had been underestimated throughout his campaign.[443] The errors in some state polls were later partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters.[444] Trump won the perennial swing states of Florida, Iowa and Ohio, and flipped Clinton's ""blue wall"" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which had been Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Trump's victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress, as was the case during parts of George W. Bush's presidency from 2003 to 2007.","Trump became the first president without prior governmental or military experience.[445][446][447] Of the 44 previous presidents, 39 had held prior elective office; two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet; and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[447] He is the first Republican since the 1980s to win the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. He lost his home state of New York, becoming only the fourth candidate to win the presidency without his home state. The others were James Polk (Tennessee) in 1844, Woodrow Wilson (New Jersey) in 1916, and Richard Nixon (New York) in 1968.[448]","Trump's victory sparked protests across the United States. Trump opponents took to the streets to amplify their opposition to Trump's views and denounce his inflammatory statements. Some argued that Clinton's popular vote victory meant Trump was not the democratically elected president and should be considered illegitimate.[449] Trump initially said on Twitter that the protests consisted of ""professional protesters, incited by the media"", and were ""unfair"", but he later stated that he loves their passion for the country.[450][451] In contrast, after Obama's re-election in 2012, Trump had tweeted ""We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!""[452]","On the Saturday following Trump's inauguration there were massive demonstrations protesting Trump in the United States and worldwide, with approximately 2,600,000 taking part in Women's Marches worldwide.[453] The most notable of these marches was the Women's March on Washington (in Washington, D.C.), where over 500,000 people marched in opposition to Trump.[454] This was more than three times the number of people who were at Trump's inaugural speech, according to crowd scientists at the Manchester Metropolitan University.[455]","On November 10, President-elect Trump had his first ever meeting with President Obama to discuss plans for a peaceful transition of power. The New York Times stated that ""It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites.""[456] The BBC stated that ""their antipathy was barely concealed"" in ""awkward photos"" of the meeting.[457]","Trump's transition team was led by Chris Christie until November 11, 2016, when Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over.[458] Since then, Trump has chosen RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff[459] and businessman and media executive Steve Bannon as White House Chief Strategist.[460]","Trump has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[461] retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor,[462] education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education,[463] Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations,[464] former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao as Secretary of Transportation,[465] U.S. Representative Tom Price as Secretary of Health and Human Services,[466] former campaign rival Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[467] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[468] billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as Secretary of Commerce,[469] retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[470] retired Marine Corps General John F. Kelly as Secretary of Homeland Security,[471] businessman Andrew Puzder as Secretary of Labor[472] (later withdrawn, replaced by attorney and law school dean Alexander Acosta),[473] CEO of ExxonMobil Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State,[474] former Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy,[475] U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke as Secretary of the Interior,[476] and Under Secretary for Health David Shulkin as Secretary of Veterans Affairs.[477]","Despite being nominated promptly during the transition period, most cabinet members were unable to take office on Inauguration Day because of delays in the formal confirmation process. By February 8, 2017, President Trump had fewer cabinet nominees confirmed than any prior president two weeks into their mandate, except George Washington.[478][479] Part of the lateness was ascribed to delays in submitting background-check paperwork, part to obstructionism by Senate Democrats.[480]","On November 22, Trump outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office in a video posted on YouTube. The plan included the United States' withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and asking the Department of Defense to develop a plan to protect the U.S. from cyber-attack.[481][482]","On December 7, Time named Trump as its ""Person of the Year"".[483] In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the ""President of the Divided States of America.""[484][485] He also opposed Time's decision to change its ""Man of the Year"" title to ""Person of the Year"" in 1999, describing the action as too ""politically correct"".[486] On December 13 he was named Financial Times Person of the Year.[487] In December 2016, Forbes ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel.[488]","Based on intelligence reports issued from October 2016 to January 2017, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of trying to influence the U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump, by supplying the DNC emails to WikiLeaks for publication.[489] Trump,[490] WikiLeaks[491] and Russian officials[492] have denied the allegations.","In January 2017, Trump was briefed on a private intelligence dossier containing ""potentially compromising personal and financial information"" about his activities in Russia,[493] which he denied.[494] The dossier was also leaked to the press and published.[495] Media evaluation of the dossier ranged from ""garbage""[496] to ""partially corroborated"".[497]","Trump's inauguration as the 45th President of the United States was held on Friday, January 20, 2017. In his first week as president, Trump signed six executive orders. His first order as president set out interim procedures in anticipation of repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). That same week, Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, re-instated the Mexico City Policy, reopened the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects and launched the process[clarification needed] to build a new Mexico border wall and reinforce border security.[498]","On January 27, President Trump signed an executive order that suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns about terrorism. The following day, thousands of protesters gathered at airports and other locations throughout the United States to protest the signing of the order and detainment of the foreign nationals.[499] Later, the administration seemed to reverse a portion of part of the order, effectively exempting visitors with a green card.[500][501] Two Iraqi nationals detained upon arrival filed a complaint.[502] Several federal judges issued rulings that curtailed parts of the immigration order, stopping the federal government from deporting visitors already affected.[501]","On March 6, 2017, Trump issued a revised executive order, that, among other differences with the original order, excluded Iraq, visa-holders, and permanent residents from the temporary suspension and did not differentiate Syrian refugees from refugees from other countries.[503]","On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[504] An invocation of the ""nuclear option"" was prompted by Trump.[505] The Senate confirmed the nomination of Gorsuch on April 7, with a 54–45 vote.[506] Gorsuch was sworn in the next day.[507]","Trump's energy policy advocates domestic industrial support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[508] His appointed advisers favor a less regulated energy market and, because they do not consider climate change a threat, see no need for immediate action.[509]","Trump does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.[510][511] In 2012, he said that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese, but later said that he was joking.[512][513] He has called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a ""disgrace"" and has threatened to cut its budget.[514] Trump has pledged to eliminate the Clean Power Plan[515] and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for reductions in carbon emissions in more than 170 countries.[516] After winning the presidency, Trump admitted ""some connectivity"" between human activity and climate variability and said he has an ""open mind"" towards the Paris agreement.[517]","Trump's immigration policies were intensely discussed during the campaign. Trump vowed to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico–United States border to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall which Trump promised Mexico would pay for.[518][519][520] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[521] and criticized birthright citizenship as it creates ""anchor babies"".[522] He said the focus of deportation would be criminals, those who have overstayed their visas, and other ""security threats"".[523]","Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to completely ban Muslim non-citizens from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[524][525][526] Later in 2016 he stated that the ban would apply only to people originating from countries with a ""proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies"", or countries ""compromised by terrorism"".[527][528][529]","In late January 2017, Trump issued an executive order banning the admission of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries.[530] The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately;[531] the measure caused chaos at many airports, with consecutive days of mass protest afflicting major airports in the United States.[532] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and a federal court blocked its implementation.[531] In early March 2017, Trump issued a revised order into law, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, no priorities for religious minorities (e.g. Christian refugees) and a week was given to implement legislation.[503][531]","Trump is conservative, describes himself as pro-life and generally opposes abortion; exceptions are made in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[533] He has said that he is committed to appointing justices who would try to overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade.[534] He personally supports ""traditional marriage""[512] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a ""settled"" issue.[534]","Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[535][536] although his views have shifted over time.[537] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[538] He favors capital punishment,[539][540] as well as the use of waterboarding.[541][542]","In 1999, Trump told Larry King Live that ""I believe in universal healthcare.""[543] Trump's 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[544] and has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[543][545][546]","However, Trump has repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare.[547][548] In March 2016, Trump's campaign released a platform summary which included a variety of free-market health reforms including provisions to allow health insurance to be sold across state lines, enable individuals to deduct health insurance premiums, expand health savings accounts, and give more control of Medicaid to the states.[549][550]","Trump aims to streamline the Department of Veterans Affairs, getting rid of backlogs and waitlists, and upgrading relevant facilities.[551] On his first Monday in office, Trump issued a federal hiring freeze on the VA.[552]","Trump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools.[553] He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools,[554] and has called Common Core ""a disaster"" that must be ended.[555] He has stated he would abolish all or part of the Department of Education.[556]","Trump's campaign tax plan called for levelling the corporate tax rate to 15%, eliminating various business loopholes and deductions,[400] and reducing the number of brackets for personal income tax: the top rate would be reduced from 39.6% to 25%, a large ""zero bracket"" would be created, and the alternative minimum tax and estate tax (which currently applies to individual estates over $5.45 million or $10.9 million per married couple) would both be eliminated.[557] His comments about the minimum wage have been inconsistent.[558][559][560]","Trump identifies as a ""free trader"", but says that trade must be ""reasonably fair"".[561] He has often been called a ""protectionist"",[562][563][564] because of his criticism of NAFTA,[565][566] the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[567] and his proposal to raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States significantly.[568][569] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[570][571] However, Trump has been very keen to support a ""fair"" post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom,[572] which Trump says would be ""good for both sides"".[573]","Trump's early policies have favored far-reaching deregulation and a smaller federal government. He became the first president in sixteen years to sign a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution; the law had been used only once before.[574] During his first six weeks in office, he abolished ninety federal regulations.[575][576]","On January 23, 2017, Trump ordered a temporary government-wide hiring freeze.[577][578] The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office told a House committee that hiring freezes have not proven to be effective in reducing costs.[579] Unlike some past freezes, the current freeze bars agencies from adding contractors to make up for employees leaving.[579]","A week later Trump signed Executive Order 13771, directing administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[580][581] Harvard Law professor Jody Freeman said that the order would do no more than slow the regulatory process, because it did not block rules required by statute.[582]","On February 24, 2017, Trump ordered the agencies to create task forces to determine which regulations are deemed burdensome to the U.S. economy.[583] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's attacks, saying that the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[584]","Trump has been described as non-interventionist[585][586] and nationalist.[587] Trump repeatedly stated that he supports ""America First"" foreign policy.[588] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[587] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[589] He says America should look inward, stop ""nation building"", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[586] As a candidate he questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[590] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[591] But as president he has re-affirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO.[592]","In order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[593] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region,[594][595] a position he later retracted.[596] Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is ""a big fan of Israel"".[597] During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv, although he has not pursued that proposal as president.[598]","Both as a candidate and as president, Trump repeatedly said he wants a good relationship with Russia.[599][600] Trump has pledged to hold a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin.[601] He added that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS militants.[602] On April 7, 2017, Trump ordered the Shayrat missile strike in retaliation for the chemical weapons attack in Syria.[603]","Trump signaled his intent to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within hours of assuming the presidency.[604][605] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[606] The early timing of the beginning of the campaign was highly unorthodox. Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[607] By February 1, 2017, the campaign had already raised over $7 million.[608]",Nominees awaiting confirmation:

Off the pitch, he ranks among the world's most prominent sportsmen; SportsPro named him the most marketable athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013, and ESPN cited him as the world's fourth-most famous athlete in 2016.",,,"Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior was born in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, to Neymar Santos, Sr. and Nadine da Silva. He inherited his name from his father, who is a former footballer and became his son's advisor as Neymar's talents began to grow.[5] Neymar comments on his father's role ""My father has been by my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family.""[6] Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football.[7]","In 2003, Neymar moved with his family to São Vicente, where he began playing for youth side Portuguesa Santista.[8] Then, later in 2003, they moved to Santos, where Neymar joined Santos FC.[9] With the success of his youth career and added income, the family bought their first property, a house next to the Vila Belmiro. Their quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning 10,000 reais per month and at 16, 125,000 reais per month. At 17, he signed his first full professional contract, was upgraded to the Santos first team, and began signing his first sponsorship deals.[10]","Neymar began playing football at an early age and he was soon spotted by Santos FC who offered him a contract in 2003, where he was inducted into their youth academy, which has, in the past, produced Brazilian internationals like Coutinho, Clodoaldo, Diego, Elano and Alex. He also joined the likes of Pepe, Pelé and Robinho in starting out his career at the club, nicknamed Peixe.[11] While in the youth academy, Neymar met Paulo Henrique Ganso, becoming good friends in the process. Aged 14, Neymar travelled to Spain to join the Real Madrid youth team, at the time when Real had stars like Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Roberto Carlos and Robinho.[12]","Neymar made his professional debut on 7 March 2009, despite being only 17 years old; he was brought on for the last thirty minutes, in a 2–1 win against Oeste.[7] The following week he scored his first goal for Santos against Mogi Mirim. One month later, on 11 April, Neymar scored the decisive goal in a 2–1 win against Palmeiras in the 2009 Campeonato Paulista semi-final first leg.[13] In the final, however, Santos suffered a 4–2 aggregate defeat to the Corinthians.[14] In his first season, Neymar racked up 14 goals in 48 games.[7]","""The 18-year-old is a magnificent prospect. He is sleek and skilful, able to beat the defender on either side, capable of combining well, and full of tricks he can put to productive use in and around the penalty area.""","Neymar continued his ascendancy in 2010, and, on 15 April 2010, he scored five goals for Santos in an 8–1 rout of Guarani in the qualifying stages of the Brazilian Cup.[16] Following the 2010 Campeonato Paulista in which Neymar scored 14 goals in 19 games,[11] the club were crowned champions after a 5–5 aggregate win over Santo André in the finals.[17] Neymar was subsequently given the award for the best player in the competition.[18] Neymar's performances for Santos have drawn comparisons to other Brazilians, including Robinho and Brazilian legend Pelé.[19]","In 2010, Santos rejected a £12 million bid for him from English Premier League team West Ham United,[20] and later an offer from another English club, Chelsea, reported to be in the region of £20 million.[21] Despite Santos unwillingness to sell and Neymar himself insisting ""I'm focused only on Santos"",[22] his agent, Wagner Ribeiro, indicated that Neymar’s career was elsewhere, stating ""He wants to become the best player in the world. The chances of him doing that while playing in Brazil are zero.""[21] Although one year later Neymar admitted, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, that he had been happy with Chelsea's interest in him as it was a ""dream"" of his ""to play in Europe"", while also stating that at the time it had been the right decision to stay in Brazil.[23]","On 30 November 2010, Santos sold a 5% share of future transfer fees that he would receive to an investment group, Terceira Estrela Investimentos S.A. (TEISA), for R$ 3,549,900 (€1.5 million).[24] The previous year, his family had sold a 40% stake in Neymar's sporting rights to the DIS Esporte group who had been a long-term strategic partner of Santos' football club.[25]","Despite his first two seasons being highly successful, having ended the 2010 season with an impressive 42 goals in 60 games, problems had been identified, namely Neymar's apparent taste for diving when tackled, rather than attempting to continue his run, and his attitude. The latter came to the forefront during a match with Atlético Goianiense, on 15 September 2010, when the Santos' manager, Dorival Júnior, appointed another player to take the penalty awarded for a foul on Neymar. His decision was based on the fact that Neymar had missed a crucial penalty during the Copa do Brasil final of that year, even if Santos went on to win. Reacting to this, Neymar turned his back on his manager, had to be calmed down by a linesman and argued with his captain, Edu Dracena. The fallout from this event was that Dorival Júnior wished to have Neymar suspended for two weeks, but the board sided with the player and promptly sacked the manager. Despite Neymar's apologies over the incident, some doubts still remain about his attitude.[7] In December 2010, aged just 18, Neymar came third for the 2010 South American Footballer of the Year, behind Andrés D'Alessandro and Juan Sebastián Verón.[26]","Neymar scored six goals during Santos run to the 2011 Copa Libertadores Finals, tying him for third top goalscorer,[27] including the clinching goal of Santos' 4–3 aggregate win over Cerro Porteño in the semifinals.[28] In the two-legged final, Santos faced Uruguayan side Peñarol and drew the first leg 0–0 in Montevideo.[29] At home in the second leg, Neymar opened the scoring in the 46th minute as Santos held on for a 2–1 win and Neymar won Man of the Match honours.[30][31] The win brought Santos their first Copa Libertadores triumph since 1963, when Brazilian legend Pelé was playing for the club.[32][33]","In September 2011, Santos club president Luís Ribeiro threatened to report Real Madrid to FIFA following reports that they had attempted to sign Neymar to a pre-contract agreement, and denied that such an agreement was in place.[34] On 9 November 2011, Neymar and Santos agreed to a contract extension that would see the player stay with the club until after the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The deal reportedly increased Neymar's wages by 50%, to the levels that top European clubs would be paying him.[35] On 14 December 2011, Neymar scored the opening goal for Santos as they defeated Kashiwa Reysol 3–1 in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup at the Toyota Stadium in Toyota, Japan, but failed to score against Barcelona in the final on 18 December 2011, where Santos were defeated 4–0, finishing as runners up in the competition.[36] He won the 2011 FIFA Puskás Award for scoring a solo goal in the Brasileirão Série A against Flamengo, in a 5–4 loss.

Kanye_West,"Kanye Omari West (/ˈkɑːnjeɪ/;[1] born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, fashion designer, and entrepreneur. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West briefly attended art school before becoming known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing hit singles for artists such as Jay Z and Alicia Keys. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He went on to pursue a variety of different styles on subsequent albums Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). In 2010, he released his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy to rave reviews from critics, and the following year he collaborated with Jay Z on the joint LP Watch the Throne (2011). West released his abrasive sixth album, Yeezus, to further critical praise in 2013. His seventh album, The Life of Pablo, was released in 2016.","West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant mainstream attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings. His more scrutinized comments include his off-script denunciation of President George W. Bush during a live 2005 television broadcast for Hurricane Katrina relief and his interruption of singer Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. West's efforts as a fashion designer include collaborations with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the YEEZY collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA. His 2014 marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian has also been subject to widespread media coverage.","West is among the most acclaimed musicians of the 21st century,[2][3][4] and is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 32 million albums and 100 million digital downloads worldwide.[5][6] He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all time and the most Grammy-awarded artist to have debuted in the 21st century.[7] Three of his albums have been included and ranked on Rolling Stone's 2012 update of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" list. He has also been included in a number of Forbes annual lists.[8] Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015.",,,"West was born on June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia.[9][10] His parents divorced when he was three years old. After the divorce, he and his mother moved to Chicago, Illinois.[11][12] His father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther and was one of the first black photojournalists at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ray West was later a Christian counselor,[12] and in 2006, opened the Good Water Store and Café in Lexington Park, Maryland with startup capital from his son.[13][14] West's mother, Dr. Donda C. (Williams) West,[15] was a professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as his manager. West was raised in a middle-class background, attending Polaris High School[16] in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois after living in Chicago.[17]","At the age of 10, West moved with his mother to Nanjing, China, where she was teaching at Nanjing University as part of an exchange program. According to his mother, West was the only foreigner in his class, but settled in well and quickly picked up the language, although he has since forgotten most of it.[18] When asked about his grades in high school, West replied, ""I got A's and B's. And I'm not even frontin'.""[19]","West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; he began writing poetry when he was five years old.[20] His mother recalled that she first took notice of West's passion for drawing and music when he was in the third grade.[21] Growing up in Chicago, West became deeply involved in its hip hop scene. He started rapping in the third grade and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling them to other artists.[22] At age thirteen, West wrote a rap song called ""Green Eggs and Ham"" and began to persuade his mother to pay $25 an hour for time in a recording studio. It was a small, crude basement studio where a microphone hung from the ceiling by a wire clothes hanger. Although this wasn't what West's mother wanted, she nonetheless supported him.[20] West crossed paths with producer/DJ No I.D., with whom he quickly formed a close friendship. No I.D. soon became West's mentor, and it was from him that West learned how to sample and program beats after he received his first sampler at age 15.[23]:557","After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes, but shortly after transferred to Chicago State University to study English. He soon realized that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his musical work, and at 20 he dropped out of college to pursue his musical dreams.[24] This action greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university. She later commented, ""It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college. For Kanye to make an album called College Dropout it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you.""[23]:558","Kanye West began his early production career in the mid-1990s, making beats primarily for burgeoning local artists, eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic soul records. His first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on Down to Earth, the 1996 debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav.[25] For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for Deric ""D-Dot"" Angelettie. Because of his association with D-Dot, West wasn't able to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and producer of the Go-Getters, a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him, GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe, and Arrowstar.[26][27] His group was managed by John ""Monopoly"" Johnson, Don Crowley, and Happy Lewis under the management firm Hustle Period. After attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances, The Go-Getters released their first and only studio album World Record Holders in 1999. The album featured other Chicago-based rappers such as Rhymefest, Mikkey Halsted, Miss Criss, and Shayla G. Meanwhile, the production was handled by West, Arrowstar, Boogz, and Brian ""All Day"" Miller.[26]","West spent much of the late 1990s producing records for a number of well-known artists and music groups.[28] The third song on Foxy Brown's second studio album Chyna Doll was produced by West. Her second effort subsequently became the very first hip-hop album by a female rapper to debut at the top of the U.S. Billboard 200 chart in its first week of release.[28] West produced three of the tracks on Harlem World's first and only album The Movement alongside Jermaine Dupri and the production duo Trackmasters. His songs featured rappers Nas, Drag-On, and R&B singer Carl Thomas.[28] The ninth track from World Party, the last Goodie Mob album to feature the rap group's four founding members prior to their break-up, was co-produced by West with his manager Deric ""D-Dot"" Angelettie.[28] At the close of the millennium, West ended up producing six songs for Tell 'Em Why U Madd, an album that was released by D-Dot under the alias of The Madd Rapper; a fictional character he created for a skit on The Notorious B.I.G.'s second and final studio album Life After Death. West's songs featured guest appearances from rappers such as Ma$e, Raekwon, and Eminem.[28]","West got his big break in the year 2000, when he began to produce for artists on Roc-A-Fella Records. West came to achieve recognition and is often credited with revitalizing Jay-Z's career with his contributions to the rap mogul's influential 2001 album The Blueprint.[29] The Blueprint is consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums, and the critical and financial success of the album generated substantial interest in West as a producer.[30] Serving as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, West produced records for other artists from the label, including Beanie Sigel, Freeway, and Cam'ron. He also crafted hit songs for Ludacris, Alicia Keys, and Janet Jackson.[29][31][32][33]","Despite his success as a producer, West's true aspiration was to be a rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal.[32] Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time.[23]:556 After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.[22]","According to Capitol Record's A&R, Joe Weinberger, he was approached by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to.[22] Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.[23]:556[34]","West's breakthrough came a year later on October 23, 2002, when, while driving home from a California recording studio after working late, he fell asleep at the wheel and was involved in a near-fatal car crash.[35] The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut.[35] The composition, ""Through The Wire"", expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West ""all the better artists have expressed what they were going through"".[36][37] West added that ""the album was my medicine"", as working on the record distracted him from the pain.[38] ""Through The Wire"" was first available on West's Get Well Soon... mixtape, released December 2002.[39] At the same time, West announced that he was working on an album called The College Dropout, whose overall theme was to ""make your own decisions. Don't let society tell you, 'This is what you have to do.'""[40]","West delivers the goods with a disarming mix of confessional honesty and sarcastic humor, earnest idealism and big-pimping materialism. In a scene still dominated by authenticity battles and gangsta posturing, he's a middle-class, politically conscious, post-thug, bourgeois rapper — and that's nothing to be ashamed of.[41]","Carrying a Louis Vuitton backpack filled with old disks and demos to the studio and back, West crafted much of his production for his debut album in less than fifteen minutes at a time. He recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident. Once he had completed the album, it was leaked months before its release date.[32] However, West decided to use the opportunity to review the album, and The College Dropout was significantly remixed, remastered, and revised before being released. As a result, certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted, among them ""Keep the Receipt"" with Ol' Dirty Bastard and ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" with Consequence.[42] West meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, improved drum programming and new verses.[32] West's perfectionism led The College Dropout to have its release postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003.[43][44]","The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, ""Through the Wire"" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks.[45] ""Slow Jamz"", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. ""Jesus Walks"", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio.[46][47] The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received).[48] During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records.[49] However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.[50] During this time, he also produced singles for Brandy, Common, John Legend, and Slum Village.[51]","Beginning his second effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars and take over a year to craft his second album.[52] West was significantly inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.[53] Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration.[53] West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks.[54] Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre.[55] Late Registration sold over 2.3 million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.[56]","While West had encountered controversy a year prior when he stormed out of the American Music Awards of 2004 after losing Best New Artist,[57] the rapper's first large-scale controversy came just days following Late Registration's release, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina victims. In September 2005, NBC broadcast A Concert for Hurricane Relief, and West was a featured speaker. When West was presenting alongside actor Mike Myers, he deviated from the prepared script. Myers spoke next and continued to read the script. Once it was West's turn to speak again, he said, ""George Bush doesn't care about black people.""[36] West's comment reached much of the United States, leading to mixed reactions; President Bush would later call it one of the most ""disgusting moments"" of his presidency.[58] West raised further controversy in January 2006 when he posed on the cover of Rolling Stone wearing a crown of thorns.[36]","Fresh off spending the previous year touring the world with U2 on their Vertigo Tour, West felt inspired to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large arenas.[59] To this end, West incorporated the synthesizer into his hip-hop production, utilized slower tempos, and experimented with electronic music and influenced by music of the 1980s.[60][61] In addition to U2, West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin in terms of melody and chord progression.[61][62] To make his next effort, the third in a planned tetralogy of education-themed studio albums,[63] more introspective and personal in lyricism, West listened to folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his wordplay and storytelling ability.[53]","West's third studio album, Graduation, garnered major publicity when its release date pitted West in a sales competition against rapper 50 Cent's Curtis.[64] Upon their September 2007 releases, Graduation outsold Curtis by a large margin, debuting at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and selling 957,000 copies in its first week.[65] Graduation once again continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West, and the album's lead single, ""Stronger"", garnered the rapper his third number-one hit.[66] ""Stronger"", which samples French house duo Daft Punk, has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s.[67] Ben Detrick of XXL cited the outcome of the sales competition between 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation as being responsible for altering the direction of hip-hop and paving the way for new rappers who didn't follow the hardcore-gangster mold, writing, ""If there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hip-hop's changing direction, it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales.""[68]","West's life took a different direction when his mother, Donda West, died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast reduction in November 2007.[69] Months later, West and fiancée Alexis Phifer ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship, which had begun in 2002.[70] The events profoundly affected West, who set off for his 2008 Glow in the Dark Tour shortly thereafter.[71] Purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, West decided to sing using the voice audio processor Auto-Tune, which would become a central part of his next effort. West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album The College Dropout for the background vocals of ""Jesus Walks"" and ""Never Let Me Down."" Recorded mostly in Honolulu, Hawaii in three weeks,[72] West announced his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed its lead single, ""Love Lockdown"". Music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of Auto-Tune, which typified the pre-release response to the record.[73]","808s & Heartbreak, which features extensive use of the eponymous Roland TR-808 drum machine and contains themes of love, loneliness, and heartache, was released by Island Def Jam to capitalize on Thanksgiving weekend in November 2008.[74][75] Reviews were positive, though slightly more mixed than his previous efforts. Despite this, the record's singles demonstrated outstanding chart performances. Upon its release, the lead single ""Love Lockdown"" debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a ""Hot Shot Debut"",[76] while follow-up single ""Heartless"" performed similarly and became his second consecutive ""Hot Shot Debut"" by debuting at number four on the Billboard Hot 100.[77] While it was criticized prior to release, 808s & Heartbreak had a significant effect on hip-hop music, encouraging other rappers to take more creative risks with their productions.[78]","West's controversial incident the following year at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was arguably his biggest controversy, and led to widespread outrage throughout the music industry.[79] During the ceremony, West crashed the stage and grabbed the microphone from winner Taylor Swift in order to proclaim that, instead, Beyoncé's video for ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"", nominated for the same award, was ""one of the best videos of all time"". He was subsequently withdrawn from the remainder of the show for his actions. West's tour with Lady Gaga was cancelled in response to the controversy.[80]","[West is] the pop star for our morally implicated times; an instinctive consumer with a mouthful of diamonds and furtive bad conscience, a performer who lives the American dream to its fullest with a creeping sense of the spiritual void at its heart. [MBDTF] captures that essence in full. It's an utterly dazzling portrait of a 21st-century schizoid man that is by turns sickeningly egocentric, contrite, wise, stupid and self-mocking.","Following the highly publicized incident, West took a brief break from music and threw himself into fashion, only to hole up in Hawaii for the next few months writing and recording his next album.[82] Importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording, West kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments. Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for Complex, was present during the sessions and described the ""communal"" atmosphere as thus: ""With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and we are here to contribute, challenge, and inspire.""[82] A variety of artists contributed to the project, including close friends Jay-Z, Kid Cudi and Pusha T, as well as off-the-wall collaborations, such as with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver.[83]","My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom considered it his best work and said it solidified his comeback.[84] In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess.[49] The record included the international hit ""All of the Lights"", and Billboard hits ""Power"", ""Monster"", and ""Runaway"", the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name.[85] During this time, West initiated the free music program GOOD Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday, a portion of which were included on the album. This promotion ran from August 20 – December 17, 2010. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States,[86] but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a ""snub"" by several media outlets.[87]","Following a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as ""one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time"",[88] West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak.[89][90] ""Niggas in Paris"" became the record's highest charting single, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.[85] In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: ""Mercy"" and ""Clique"".[85] West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens.[91]","Sessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel.[92] Determined to ""undermine the commercial"",[93] he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music.[94] Primarily inspired by architecture,[92] West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach.[95] Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.[96][97] Yeezus, West's sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics.[98] It became the rapper's sixth consecutive number one debut, but also marked his lowest solo opening week sales.[99] Def Jam issued ""Black Skinhead"" to radio in July 2013 as the album's lead single.[100]","On September 6, 2013, Kanye West announced he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support Yeezus, with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar accompanying him as supporting act.[101][102] The tour was met with rave reviews from critics.[103] Rolling Stone described it as ""crazily entertaining, hugely ambitious, emotionally affecting (really!) and, most importantly, totally bonkers.""[103] Writing for Forbes, Zack O'Malley Greenburg praised West for ""taking risks that few pop stars, if any, are willing to take in today's hyper-exposed world of pop,"" describing the show as ""overwrought and uncomfortable at times, but [it] excels at challenging norms and provoking thought in a way that just isn't common for mainstream musical acts of late.""[104]","In June 2013, West and television personality Kim Kardashian announced the birth of their first child, North. In October 2013, West and Kardashian announced their engagement to widespread media attention.[105] November 2013, West stated that he was beginning work on his next studio album, hoping to release it by mid-2014,[106] with production by Rick Rubin and Q-Tip.[107] In December 2013, Adidas announced the beginning of their official apparel collaboration with West, to be premiered the following year.[108] In May 2014, West and Kardashian were married in a private ceremony in Florence, Italy, with a variety of artists and celebrities in attendance.[105] West released a single, ""Only One"", featuring Paul McCartney, on December 31, 2014.[109]","""FourFiveSeconds"", a single jointly produced with Rihanna and McCartney, was released in January 2015. West also appeared on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, where he premiered a new song entitled ""Wolves"", featuring Sia Furler and fellow Chicago rapper, Vic Mensa. In February 2015, West premiered his clothing collaboration with Adidas, entitled Yeezy Season 1, to generally positive reviews. This would include West's Yeezy Boost sneakers.[110] In March 2015, West released the single ""All Day"" featuring Theophilus London, Allan Kingdom and Paul McCartney.[111] West performed the song at the 2015 BRIT Awards with a number of US rappers and UK grime MC's including: Skepta, Wiley, Novelist, Fekky, Krept & Konan, Stormzy, Allan Kingdom, Theophilus London and Vic Mensa.[112] He would premiere the second iteration of his clothing line, Yeezy Season 2, in September 2015 at New York Fashion Week.[113]","Having initially announced a new album entitled So Help Me God slated for a 2014 release, in March 2015 West announced that the album would instead be tentatively called SWISH.[114] Later that month, West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions to music, fashion, and popular culture, officially making him an honorary DFA.[115] The next month, West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance.[116] Toward the end of the set, West proclaimed himself: ""the greatest living rock star on the planet.""[117] Media outlets, including social media sites such as Twitter, were divided on his performance.[118][119] NME stated, ""The decision to book West for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement, and the show itself appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their TVs.""[119] The publication added that ""he's letting his music speak for and prove itself.""[120] The Guardian said that ""his set has a potent ferocity – but there are gaps and stutters, and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd.""[121] In December 2015, West released a song titled ""Facts"".[122]","West announced in January 2016 that SWISH would be released on February 11, and that month released new songs ""Real Friends"" and a snippet of ""No More Parties in L.A."" with Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden.[123] In the weeks leading up to the album's release, West became embroiled in several Twitter controversies[124] and released several changing iterations of the track list for the new album. Several days ahead of its release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo.[125] On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line.[126] Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public,[127] and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track ""Waves"" at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper. He released the album exclusively on Tidal on 14 February 2016 following a performance on SNL.[128][129] Following its official streaming release, West continued to tinker with mixes of several tracks, describing the work as ""a living breathing changing creative expression""[130] and proclaiming the end of the album as a dominant release form.[131] Although a statement by West around Life of Pablo's initial release indicated that the album would be a permanent exclusive to Tidal, the album was released through several other competing services starting in April.[132]","On February 24, 2016, West stated on Twitter that he was planning to release another album in the summer of 2016, tentatively called Turbo Grafx 16 in reference to the 1990s video game console of the same name.[133][134] On June 3, 2016, West premiered the first single ""Champions"" off the GOOD Music album Cruel Winter, which was six minutes and featured Travis Scott, Big Sean, Gucci Mane, Desiigner, Yo Gotti, Quavo, and 2 Chainz.[135][136] He told the radio host, Big Boy, that the beat had been in works for a year and a half.[135] In June, West released a controversial video for ""Famous,"" which depicted wax figures of several celebrities (including West, Kardashian, Taylor Swift, president and businessman Donald Trump, comedian Bill Cosby, and former president George W. Bush) sleeping nude in a shared bed.[137] In August 2016, West embarked on the Saint Pablo Tour in support of The Life of Pablo.[138] The performances featured a mobile stage suspended from the ceiling.[138] West postponed several dates in October following the Paris robbery of his wife Kim Kardashian.[139] On November 21, 2016, West cancelled the remaining 21 dates on the Saint Pablo Tour, following a week of no-shows, curtailed concerts and rants about politics.[140] He was later admitted for psychiatric observation at UCLA Medical Center.[141][142] He stayed hospitalized over the Thanksgiving weekend stemming from a temporary psychosis stemming from sleep deprivation and extreme dehydration.[143]The current West seems to be based on trying to create a world that he wants his daughter, North, to grow up in. In an interview for Paper (magazine) West states that all that time, all the seemingly sporadic actions and outbursts, he was fighting for his daughter Nori’s future “‘Let's just tap back into the real world for a second we can have children. Let’s be thankful, we can raise our kids, let’s be thankful. But how about we raise our kids in a truthful world, not a world based on brands and concepts of perception? Perception is not reality. When I look in North's eyes, I'm happy about every mistake I've ever made. I'm happy that I fought to bring some type of reality to this world we choose to stay in right now, driven by brands and corporations.'""[144]","West's musical career has been defined by frequent stylistic shifts and different musical approaches. Asked about his early musical inspirations, he named artists such as A Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael, LL Cool J, Phil Collins and Madonna.[145] Other music figures West has invoked as inspirations include Puff Daddy,[146] David Bowie,[147] Miles Davis and Gil-Scott Heron.[148] West was formatively mentored by Chicago producer No I.D., who introduced him to hip hop production in the early 1990s, allowing a teenage West to sit in on recording sessions.[149] Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed ""chipmunk soul""[150][151] which utilized pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul and R&B songs, along with his own drums and instrumentation.[152] His first major release featuring his trademark soulful vocal sampling style was ""This Can't Be Life"", a track from Jay-Z's The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West has noted Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA as an influence on his style.[17][153]","West further developed his style on his 2004 debut album, The College Dropout. After a rough version was leaked, West meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, and improved drum programming.[32] The album saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects[37] including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, family, sexuality, and his personal struggles in the music industry.[154][155] For his second album, Late Registration (2005), he collaborated with film score composer Jon Brion and drew influence from non-rap influences such as English trip hop group Portishead.[53] Blending West's primary soulful hip hop production with Brion's elaborate chamber pop orchestration, the album experimentally incorporated a wide array of different genres and prominent orchestral elements, including string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs,[54] amid a myriad of foreign and vintage instruments.[156] Critic Robert Christgau wrote that ""there's never been hip-hop so complex and subtle musically.""[157] With his third album, Graduation (2007), West moved away from the soulful sound of his previous releases and towards a more atmospheric, rock-tinged, electronic-influenced style,[158] drawing on European Britpop and Euro-disco, American alternative and indie-rock, and his native Chicago house.[159][160] West retracted much of the live instrumentation that characterized his previous album and replaced it with distorted, gothic synthesizers,[161] rave stabs, house beats, electro-disco rhythms, and a wide array of modulated electronic noises and digital audio-effects.[60][160] In addition, West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones, U2, and Led Zeppelin.[61][62] In comparison to previous albums, Graduation is more introspective, exploring West's own fame and personal issues.[162]","808s & Heartbreak (2008), marked a radical departure from his previous releases,[163] largely abandoning rap and hip hop stylings in favor of an emotive, stark electropop sound[164][165][166] that juxtaposed Auto-Tuned sung vocals and the distorted Roland TR-808 drum machine[167] with droning synthesizers, lengthy strings, somber piano, and tribal rhythms.[168] The album drew comparisons to the work of 1980s post-punk and new wave groups;[168] West would confess an affinity with artists such as Joy Division,[169] Gary Numan, and TJ Swan[170][171] and later described 808s as ""the first black new wave album.""[172] Discussing the album's influence on subsequent hip hop and R&B music, Rolling Stone journalist Matthew Trammell described 808s as ""Kanye's most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant.""[173] West recorded his fifth album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), with a wide range of collaborators. The album engages with themes of excess, celebrity, and decadence,[174] has been noted by writers for its maximalist aesthetic and its incorporation of elements from West's previous four albums.[31][175][176] Entertainment Weekly's Simon Vozick-Levinson noted that such elements ""all recur at various points"", namely ""the luxurious soul of 2004's The College Dropout, the symphonic pomp of Late Registration, the gloss of 2007's Graduation, and the emotionally exhausted electro of 2008's 808s & Heartbreak.""[175] In a positive review, Andy Gill of The Independent called it ""one of pop's gaudiest, most grandiose efforts of recent years, a no-holds-barred musical extravaganza in which any notion of good taste is abandoned at the door"".[177]","Describing his sixth studio album Yeezus (2013) as ""a protest to music,""[178] West embraced an abrasive style that incorporated a variety of unconventional influences. Music critic Greg Kot described it as ""a hostile, abrasive and intentionally off-putting"" album that combines ""the worlds of"" 1980s acid-house and contemporary Chicago drill music, 1990s industrial music, and the ""avant-rap"" of Saul Williams, Death Grips and Odd Future.[94] The album also incorporates elements of trap music,[179] as well as dancehall, punk, and electro.[179][180][181] Inspired by the minimalist design of Le Corbusier[172] and primarily electronic in nature, and continues West's practice of eclectic and unusual samples.[182] Rolling Stone called the album a ""brilliant, obsessive-compulsive career auto-correct"".[183] West's seventh album The Life of Pablo was noted for its ""raw, occasionally even intentionally messy, composition"" in distinction to West's previous album.[184] Rolling Stone wrote that ""It's designed to sound like a work in progress."" Carl Wilson of Slate characterized the album as creating ""strange links between Kanye's many iterations—soul-sample enthusiast, heartbroken Auto-Tune crooner, hedonistic avant-pop composer, industrial-rap shit-talker."" West initially characterized the release as ""a gospel album."" Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote in his review of The Life of Pablo, ""West's version of gospel touches on some of those sonic cues — heavy organ, soaring choirs — but seems more preoccupied with gospel text and the notion of redemption.""[185]","Early in his career, West made clear his interest in fashion and desire to work in the clothing design industry.[36][92] In September 2005, West announced that he would release his Pastelle Clothing line in spring 2006, claiming ""Now that I have a Grammy under my belt and Late Registration is finished, I am ready to launch my clothing line next spring.""[186] The line was developed over the following four years – with multiple pieces teased by West himself – before the line was ultimately cancelled in 2009.[187][188] In 2009, West collaborated with Nike to release his own shoe, the Air Yeezys, with a second version released in 2012. In January 2009, West introduced his first shoe line designed for Louis Vuitton during Paris Fashion Week. The line was released in summer 2009.[189] West has additionally designed shoewear for Bape and Italian shoemaker Giuseppe Zanotti.[190]","On October 1, 2011, Kanye West premiered his women's fashion label, DW Kanye West[191] at Paris Fashion Week. He received support from DSquared2 duo Dean and Dan Caten, Olivier Theyskens, Jeremy Scott, Azzedine Alaïa, and the Olsen twins, who were also in attendance during his show. His debut fashion show received mixed-to-negative reviews,[192] ranging from reserved observations by Style.com[193] to excoriating commentary in The Wall Street Journal,[194] The New York Times,[195] the International Herald Tribune, Elleuk.com, The Daily Telegraph, Harper's Bazaar and many others.[196][197][198] On March 6, 2012, West premiered a second fashion line at Paris Fashion Week.[199][200] The line's reception was markedly improved from the previous presentation, with a number of critics heralding West for his ""much improved"" sophomore effort.[201]","On December 3, 2013, Adidas officially confirmed a new shoe collaboration deal with West.[108] After months of anticipation and rumors, West confirmed the release of the Adidas Yeezy Boosts. In 2015, West unveiled his Yeezy Season clothing line, premiering Season 1 in collaboration with Adidas early in the year.[202] The line received positive critical reviews, with Vogue observing ""a protective toughness, a body-conscious severity that made the clothes more than a simple accessory.""[203] The release of the Yeezy Boosts and the full Adidas collaboration was showcased in New York City on February 12, 2015, with free streaming to 50 cinemas in 13 countries around the world.[204] An initial release of the Adidas Yeezy Boosts was limited to 9000 pairs to be available only in New York City via the Adidas smartphone app; the Adidas Yeezy Boosts were sold out within 10 minutes.[205] The shoes released worldwide on February 28, 2015, were limited to select boutique stores and the Adidas UK stores. He followed with Season 2 later that year at New York Fashion Week.[110] On February 11, West premiered his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden in conjunction with the previewing of his album The Life of Pablo.[126] In June 2016, Adidas announced a new long-term contract with Kanye West which sees the Yeezy line extend to a number of stores and enter sports performance products.[206] The Yeezys will be seen in basketball, football, soccer, and more.[206]","In February 2017, West unveiled the Yeezy Season 5 collection to favorable responses from critics.[207]","West founded the record label and production company GOOD Music in 2004, in conjunction with Sony BMG, shortly after releasing his debut album, The College Dropout. John Legend, Common, and West were the label's inaugural artists.[208] The label houses artists including West, Big Sean, Pusha T, Teyana Taylor, Yasiin Bey / Mos Def, D'banj and John Legend, and producers including Hudson Mohawke, Q-Tip, Travis Scott, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, and S1. GOOD Music has released ten albums certified gold or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In November 2015, West appointed Pusha T the new president of GOOD Music.[209]","In August 2008, West revealed plans to open 10 Fatburger restaurants in the Chicago area; the first was set to open in September 2008 in Orland Park. The second followed in January 2009, while a third location is yet to be revealed, although the process is being finalized. His company, KW Foods LLC, bought the rights to the chain in Chicago.[210] Ultimately, in 2009, only two locations actually opened. In February 2011, West shut down the Fatburger located in Orland Park.[211] Later that year, the remaining Beverly location also was shuttered.[212]","On January 5, 2012, West announced his establishment of the creative content company DONDA, named after his late mother Donda West.[213] In his announcement, West proclaimed that the company would ""pick up where Steve Jobs left off""; DONDA would operate as ""a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers in a creative space to bounce their dreams and ideas"" with the ""goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford.""[214] West is notoriously secretive about the company's operations, maintaining neither an official website nor a social media presence.[215][216] In stating DONDA's creative philosophy, West articulated the need to ""put creatives in a room together with like minds"" in order to ""simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see, taste, touch, and feel."".[214] Contemporary critics have noted the consistent minimalistic aesthetic exhibited throughout DONDA creative projects.[217][218][219]","On March 30, 2015, it was announced that West is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the music streaming service Tidal. The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[220] Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Rihanna, Beyoncé, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.[221] The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties.[222] ""The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value"", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.[223]","On June 6, 2016, West announced the Yeezy Season 2 Zine and the Adidas Yeezy Boost 750 will be released to retailers on June 11.[224] They are high-top shoes with a glow in the dark sole.[224] In an interview with Vogue, he stated that there will be Yeezy stores with the first located in California.[225]","West, alongside his mother, founded the ""Kanye West Foundation"" in Chicago in 2003, tasked with a mission to battle dropout and illiteracy rates, while partnering with community organizations to provide underprivileged youth access to music education.[226] In 2007, the West and the Foundation partnered with Strong American Schools as part of their ""Ed in '08"" campaign.[227][228] As spokesman for the campaign, West appeared in a series of PSAs for the organization, and hosted an inaugural benefit concert in August of that year.[229]","In 2008, following the death of West's mother, the foundation was rechristened ""The Dr. Donda West Foundation."" [226][230] The foundation ceased operations in 2011.[231]","Kanye West and friend, Rhymefest, also founded ""Donda's House, Inc"". Got Bars is the Donda's House signature music/lyric composition and performance program. Participants are selected through an application and audition process. Got Bars is a free music writing program with the goal of helping at-risk Chicago youth. It is aimed at students between 15 and 24, and includes lessons on how to write and record music. Their curriculum is based on the teaching philosophy and pedagogy of Dr. Donda West with a focus on collaborative and experiential learning.[232]","West has additionally appeared and participated in many fundraisers, benefit concerts, and has done community work for Hurricane Katrina relief, the Kanye West Foundation, the Millions More Movement, 100 Black Men of America, a Live Earth concert benefit, World Water Day rally and march, Nike runs, and a MTV special helping young Iraq War veterans who struggle through debt and PTSD a second chance after returning home.[233]","In September 2015, West announced that he intends to run for President of the United States in 2020.[234][235][236]","On December 13, 2016, West met with President-elect Donald Trump[237] to discuss (according to West) ""bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago.""[238] The rapper previously stated he would have voted for Trump had he voted.[239] He later implied on Twitter that he intends to run for President in 2024 due to Trump's win in the 2016 elections.[240][241] In February 2017, however, West deleted all of his tweets about Trump in purported dislike of the new president's policies, particularly the travel ban.[242]","West has been an outspoken and controversial celebrity throughout his career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents.[36][92] On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC, A Concert for Hurricane Relief, West (a featured speaker) accused President George W. Bush of not ""car[ing] about black people"". When West was presenting alongside actor Mike Myers, he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media's portrayal of hurricane victims, saying:","I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.' And, you know, it's been five days [waiting for federal help] because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help—with the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way—and they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!","Myers spoke next and continued to read the script. Once it was West's turn to speak again, he said, ""George Bush doesn't care about black people."" At this point, telethon producer Rick Kaplan cut off the microphone and then cut away to Chris Tucker, who was unaware of the cut for a few seconds. Still, West's comment reached much of the United States.[243][244] Bush stated in an interview that the comment was ""one of the most disgusting moments"" of his presidency.[58] In November 2010, in a taped interview with Matt Lauer for the Today show, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. ""I would tell George Bush in my moment of frustration, I didn't have the grounds to call him a racist"", he told Lauer. ""I believe that in a situation of high emotion like that we as human beings don't always choose the right words."" The following day, Bush reacted to the apology in a live interview with Lauer saying he appreciated the rapper's remorse. ""I'm not a hater"", Bush said. ""I don't hate Kanye West. I was talking about an environment in which people were willing to say things that hurt. Nobody wants to be called a racist if in your heart you believe in equality of races.""[245] Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize. ""It was not the particulars of your words that mattered, it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that many of us have felt for far too long"", argued Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons.[246] Bush himself was receptive to the apology, saying, ""I appreciate that. It wasn't just Kanye West who was talking like that during Katrina, I cited him as an example, I cited others as an example as well. You know, I appreciate that.""[247]","In September 2013, West was widely rebuked by human rights groups for performing in Kazakhstan at the wedding of authoritarian President Nursultan Nazarbayev's grandson. He traveled to Kazakhstan, which has one of the poorest human rights records in the world, as a personal guest of Nazarbayev.[248] Other notable Western performers, including Sting, have previously cancelled performances in the country over human rights concerns.[249][250] West was reportedly paid US$3 million for his performance.[250] West had previously participated in cultural boycotts, joining Shakira and Rage Against The Machine in refusing to perform in Arizona after the 2010 implementation of stop and search laws directed against potential illegal aliens.[251]","Later in 2013, West launched a tirade on Twitter directed at talk show host Jimmy Kimmel after his ABC program Jimmy Kimmel Live! ran a sketch on September 25 involving two children re-enacting West's recent interview with Zane Lowe for BBC Radio 1 in which he calls himself the biggest rock star on the planet. Kimmel reveals the following night that West called him to demand an apology shortly before taping.[252]","During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West explained why he believed that President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: ""Man, let me tell you something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that.""[253] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: ""There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government.""[254] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that ""I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult.""[255]","In February 2016, West again became embroiled in controversy when he posted a tweet seemingly asserting Bill Cosby's innocence in the wake of over 50 women making allegations of sexual assault directed at Cosby.[256] That same month, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper Wiz Khalifa on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested West's mention of her and Khalifa's child.[257] The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled.[258]","Over the course of his career, West has been known to compare himself to various influential figures and entities in art and culture, including Apple founder Steve Jobs, animator Walt Disney, pop artist Andy Warhol, entrepreneur Howard Hughes, singer Michael Jackson, Renaissance-era polymath Leonardo da Vinci, fashion designers Ralph Lauren and Anna Wintour, athletics company Nike, and technology company Google.[259][260]","In 2004, West had his first of a number of public incidents during his attendance at music award events. At the American Music Awards of 2004, West stormed out of the auditorium after losing Best New Artist to country singer Gretchen Wilson. He later commented, ""I felt like I was definitely robbed [...] I was the best new artist this year.""[57] After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released, West said he would ""really have a problem"" if he did not win the Album of the Year, saying, ""I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I stunt – you can never take away from the amount of work I put into it. I don't want to hear all of that politically correct stuff.""[261] On November 2, 2006, when his ""Touch the Sky"" failed to win Best Video at the MTV Europe Music Awards, West went onto the stage as the award was being presented to Justice and Simian for ""We Are Your Friends"" and argued that he should have won the award instead.[262][263] Hundreds of news outlets worldwide criticized the outburst. On November 7, 2006, West apologized for this outburst publicly during his performance as support act for U2 for their Vertigo concert in Brisbane.[264] He later spoofed the incident on the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live in September 2007.[265]","On September 9, 2007, West suggested that his race had something to do with his being overlooked for opening the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in favor of Britney Spears; he claimed, ""Maybe my skin's not right.""[266] West was performing at the event; that night, he lost all five awards that he was nominated for, including Best Male Artist and Video of the Year. After the show, he was visibly upset that he had lost at the VMAs two years in a row, stating that he would not come back to MTV ever again. He also appeared on several radio stations saying that when he made the song ""Stronger"" that it was his dream to open the VMAs with it. He has also stated that Spears has not had a hit in a long period of time and that MTV exploited her for ratings.[267]","On September 13, 2009, during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards while Taylor Swift was accepting her award for Best Female Video for ""You Belong with Me"", West went on stage and grabbed the microphone to proclaim that Beyoncé's video for ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"", nominated for the same award, was ""one of the best videos of all time"". He was subsequently removed from the remainder of the show for his actions.[79][268][269] When Beyoncé later won the award for Best Video of the Year for ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"", she called Swift up on stage so that she could finish her acceptance speech.[268] West was criticized by various celebrities for the outburst,[79][270][271][272] and by President Barack Obama, who called West a ""jackass"".[273][274][275][276] In addition, West's VMA disruption sparked a large influx of Internet photo memes with blogs, forums and ""tweets"" with the ""Let you finish"" photo-jokes.[277] He posted a Tweet soon after the event where he stated, ""Everybody wanna booooo me but I'm a fan of real pop culture... I'm not crazy y'all, I'm just real.""[278] He then posted two apologies for the outburst on his personal blog; one on the night of the incident, and the other the following day, when he also apologized during an appearance on The Jay Leno Show.[271][279] After Swift appeared on The View two days after the outburst, partly to discuss the matter, West called her to apologize personally. Swift said she accepted his apology.[280][281][282]","In September 2010, West wrote a series of apologetic tweets addressed to Swift including ""Beyonce didn't need that. MTV didn't need that and Taylor and her family friends and fans definitely didn't want or need that"" and concluding with ""I'm sorry Taylor."" He also revealed he had written a song for Swift and if she did not accept the song, he would perform it himself.[283] However, on November 8, 2010, in an interview with a Minnesota radio station, he seemed to recant his past apologies by attempting to describe the act at the 2009 awards show as ""selfless"" and downgrade the perception of disrespect it created.[284][285] West's 2016 single ""Famous"" was met with scrutiny for a controversial lyrical reference to Taylor Swift: ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/Why?/I made that bitch famous!""[286][287][288][289][290][291] After West claimed to have obtained Swift's approval over the criticized lyric, Swift denied the claim, criticizing West and denouncing the lyric as ""misogynistic"" in a statement.[289][290][291] Several months later, West's wife Kim Kardashian released a video allegedly capturing a conversation between Swift and West in which Swift appears to approve the lyric, seemingly validating West's claim.[286][292][293]","On February 8, 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, West walked on stage as Beck was accepting his award for Album of the Year and then walked off stage, leaving the audience to think he was joking. After the awards show, West stated in an interview that he was not joking and that ""Beck needs to respect artistry, he should have given his award to Beyoncé"".[294] On February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Beck on Twitter.[295]","On August 30, 2015, West was presented with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. In his acceptance speech, he stated, ""Y'all might be thinking right now, 'I wonder did he smoke something before he came out here?' And the answer is: 'Yes, I rolled up a little something. I knocked the edge off.'""[296] At the end of his speech, he announced, ""I have decided in 2020 to run for president.""[297][298]","Music fans have turned to Change.org around the globe to try and block West's participation at various events. The largest unsuccessful petition has been to the Glastonbury Festival 2015 with 133,000+ voters stating they would prefer a rock band to headline.[299] On July 20, 2015,[300] within five days of West's announcement as the headlining artist of the closing ceremonies[301] of the 2015 Pan American Games, Change.org user XYZ collected over 50,000 signatures for West's removal as headliner,[302] on the grounds that the headlining artist should be Canadian. In his Pan American Games Closing Ceremony performance, close to the end of his performance, West closed the show by tossing his faulty microphone in the air and walked off stage.[303]","West began an on-and-off relationship with designer Alexis Phifer in 2002, and they became engaged in August 2006. The pair ended their 18-month engagement in 2008.[304] West subsequently dated model Amber Rose from 2008 until the summer of 2010.[305] West began dating reality star and longtime friend[306] Kim Kardashian in April 2012.[307] West and Kardashian became engaged in October 2013,[308][309] and married on May 24, 2014 at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.[310] Their private ceremony was subject to widespread mainstream coverage, with West taking issue with the couple's portrayal in the media.[311] They have two children: daughter North ""Nori"" West (born June 15, 2013)[312][313] and son Saint West (born December 5, 2015).[314] In April 2015, West and Kardashian traveled to Jerusalem to have North baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church at the Cathedral of St. James.[315] The couple's high status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as ""a historic blizzard of celebrity.""[316]","On November 10, 2007, at approximately 7:35 pm, paramedics responding to an emergency call transported West's mother, Donda West, to the nearby Centinela Freeman Hospital in Marina del Rey, California. She was unresponsive in the emergency room, and after resuscitation attempts, doctors pronounced her dead at approximately 8:30 pm,[317] at age 58.[318] The Los Angeles County coroner's office said in January 2008 that West had died of heart disease while suffering ""multiple post-operative factors"" after plastic surgery. She had undergone liposuction and breast reduction.[318] Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Andre Aboolian had refused to do the surgery because West had a health condition that placed her at risk for a heart attack.[317] Aboolian referred her to an internist to investigate her cardiac issue.[317] She never met with the doctor recommended by Aboolian and had the procedures performed by a third doctor, Jan Adams.[317]","Adams sent condolences to Donda West's family but declined to publicly discuss the procedure, citing confidentiality. West's family, through celebrity attorney Ed McPherson, filed complaints with the Medical Board against Adams and Aboolian for violating patient confidentiality following her death.[319] Adams had previously been under scrutiny by the medical board.[320][321] He appeared on Larry King Live on November 20, 2007, but left before speaking. Two months later, he appeared again, with his attorney, stating he was there to ""defend himself"". He said that the recently released autopsy results ""spoke for themselves"".[322] The final coroner's report January 10, 2008, concluded that Donda West died of ""coronary artery disease and multiple post-operative factors due to or as a consequence of liposuction and mammoplasty"".[323]","The funeral and burial for Donda West was held in Oklahoma City on November 20, 2007.[324] West played his first concert following the funeral at The O2 in London on November 22. He dedicated a performance of ""Hey Mama"", as well as a cover of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"", to his mother, and did so on all other dates of his Glow in the Dark tour.[325]","At a December 2008 press conference in New Zealand, West spoke about his mother's death for the first time. ""It was like losing an arm and a leg and trying to walk through that"", he told reporters.[326]","California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the ""Donda West Law"", legislation which makes it mandatory for patients to provide medical clearance for elective cosmetic surgery.[327]","In December 2006, Robert ""Evel"" Knievel sued West for trademark infringement in West's video for ""Touch the Sky"". Knievel took issue with a ""sexually charged video"" in which West takes on the persona of ""Evel Kanyevel"" and attempts flying a rocket over a canyon. The suit claimed infringement on Knievel's trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claimed that the ""vulgar and offensive"" images depicted in the video damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video.[328] West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the First Amendment. Just days before his death in November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit from West, saying, ""I thought he was a wonderful guy and quite a gentleman.""[329]","On September 11, 2008, West and his road manager/bodyguard Don ""Don C."" Crowley were arrested at Los Angeles International Airport and booked on charges of felony vandalism after an altercation with the paparazzi in which West and Crowley broke the photographers' cameras.[330][331] West was later released from the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division station in Culver City on $20,000 bail bond. On September 26, 2008, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said it would not file felony counts against West over the incident. Instead the case file was forwarded to the city attorney's office, which charged West with one count of misdemeanor vandalism, one count of grand theft and one count of battery and his manager with three counts of each on March 18, 2009.[332] West's and Crowley's arraignment was delayed from an original date of April 14, 2009.[333]","West was arrested again on November 14, 2008 at the Hilton hotel near Gateshead after another scuffle involving a photographer outside the famous Tup Tup Palace nightclub in Newcastle upon Tyne. He was later released ""with no further action"", according to a police spokesperson.[334]","On July 19, 2013, West was leaving LAX as he was surrounded by dozens of paparazzi. West became increasingly agitated as a photographer, Daniel Ramos, continued to ask him why people were not allowed to speak in his presence. West then says, ""I told you don't talk to me, right? You trying to get me in trouble so I steal off on you and have to pay you like $250,000 and shit."" Then he allegedly charged the man and grabbed him and his camera. The incident captured by TMZ, took place for a few seconds before a female voice can be heard telling West to stop. West then released the man, and his camera, and drove away from the scene. Medics were later called to the scene on behalf of the photographer who was grabbed. It was reported West could be charged with felony attempted robbery behind the matter.[335] However, the charges were reduced to misdemeanor criminal battery and attempted grand theft.[336] In March 2014, West was sentenced to serve two years' probation for the misdemeanor battery conviction and required to attend 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service and pay restitution to Ramos.[337]","After the success of his song ""Jesus Walks"" from the album The College Dropout, West was questioned on his beliefs and said, ""I will say that I'm spiritual. I have accepted Jesus as my Savior. And I will say that I fall short every day.""[338] In a 2008 interview with The Fader, West stated that ""I'm like a vessel, and God has chosen me to be the voice and the connector.""[339]","In a 2009 interview with online magazine Bossip, West clarified that he believed in God, but ""would never go into a religion,"" explaining that ""I feel like religion is more about separation and judgment than bringing people together and understanding. That's all I'm about.""[340]","In 2010, for a screening for his movie Runaway, West told the audience he once considered suicide.[341] On November 20, 2016, soon before abruptly ending a concert prematurely he said, ""Jay Z—call me, bruh. You still ain't called me. Jay Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send them at my head. Please call me. Talk to me like a man.""[342] The following day, he was committed to the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. Contrary to what early reports said, however, West was not actually taken to the hospital involuntarily; he was persuaded to do so by authorities.[343] While the episode was first described as one of ""temporary psychosis"" caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West's mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy;[344] he was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization,[345] but remains formally undiagnosed.[346] The Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia.[347] On November 30, West was released from the hospital.[348]","Mr. West has had the most sui generis hip-hop career of the last decade. No rapper has embodied hip-hop's often contradictory impulses of narcissism and social good quite as he has, and no producer has celebrated the lush and the ornate quite as he has. He has spent most of his career in additive mode, figuring out how to make music that's majestic and thought-provoking and grand-scaled. And he's also widened the genre's gates, whether for middle-class values or high-fashion and high-art dreams.","West is among the most critically acclaimed artists of the twenty-first century, receiving praise from music critics, fans, fellow musicians, artists, and wider cultural figures for his work.[2][4] AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier writes of his impact, ""As his career progressed throughout the early 21st century, West shattered certain stereotypes about rappers, becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance, his rhetoric, or his music to fit any one musical mold.""[36] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that West has been ""a frequent lightning rod for controversy, a bombastic figure who can count rankling two presidents among his achievements.""[92] Village Voice Media senior editor Ben Westhoff dubbed him the greatest hip hop artist of all time, writing that ""he's made the best albums and changed the game the most, and his music is the most likely to endure,""[349] while Complex called him the 21st century's ""most important artist of any art form, of any genre.""[350] In 2016, The Guardian compared West to the late David Bowie within the ""modern mainstream"", arguing that ""there is nobody else who can sell as many records as West does [...] while remaining so resolutely experimental and capable of stirring things up culturally and politically.""[351]","Rolling Stone credited West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, ""establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap [...]"", and called him ""as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced—a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up.""[352] West's middle-class background, flamboyant fashion sense and outspokenness have set him apart from other rappers.[36][92] Early in his career, he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop.[353] The sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold.[68] Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it ""highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative.""[354] West's 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak polarized listeners upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically,[36] as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy.[355][356][357][358][359] According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to rap about gunplay or drug-dealing.[68] In 2013, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin described West as fronting a ""new art-pop era"" in contemporary music, in which musicians draw widely on the visual arts as a signifier of both creative exploration and extravagant wealth.[360]","A substantial number of artists and other figures have professed admiration for West's work, including hip hop artists Rakim,[361] RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, Chuck D of Public Enemy,[362] and DJ Premier of Gang Starr.[363][364] Experimental rock pioneer and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed said of West that ""the guy really, really, really is talented. He's really trying to raise the bar. No one's near doing what he's doing, it's not even on the same planet.""[365] Musicians such as Paul McCartney[366] and Prince[367] have also commended West's work. Famed Tesla Motors CEO and inventor Elon Musk complimented West in a piece for Time Magazine's 100 most influential people list, writing that:","""Kanye West would be the first person to tell you he belongs on this list. The dude doesn't believe in false modesty, and he shouldn't [...] He fought for his place in the cultural pantheon with a purpose. In his debut album, over a decade ago, Kanye issued what amounted to a social critique and a call to arms (with a beat): ""We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think."" But Kanye does think. Constantly. About everything. And he wants everybody else to do the same: to engage, question, push boundaries. Now that he's a pop-culture juggernaut, he has the platform to achieve just that. He's not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process. Kanye's been playing the long game all along, and we're only just beginning to see why.""[368]","Drake, Nicki Minaj and Casey Veggies have acknowledged being influenced directly by West.[369][370][371] Non-rap artists such as English singer-songwriters Adele and Lily Allen,[372][373] New Zealand artist Lorde,[374] American electropop singer Halsey,[375] English rock band Arctic Monkeys,[376] Sergio Pizzorno of English rock band Kasabian[377] and the American indie rock bands MGMT[378] and Yeah Yeah Yeahs[379] have cited West as an influence. Experimental and electronic artists such as James Blake[380] Daniel Lopatin,[381] and Tim Hecker[382] have also cited West's work as an inspiration.","West's first seven solo studio albums have all gone platinum and he holds the record for having the most consecutive studio albums to debut at number one on the Billboard 200.[383] His albums have received numerous awards and critical acclaim.[384] Additionally West holds the record for most appearances on MTV's Hottest MCs in the Game list as well as the most wins.

Kaká,"Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʁiˈkaɾdu iˈzɛksõw duˈsɐ̃tus ˈlejt͡ʃi]; born 22 April 1982), commonly known as Kaká (Portuguese: [kaˈka] ( listen)) or Ricardo Kaká,[3][4][5][6] is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Orlando City in Major League Soccer and the Brazil national team.","Kaká started his footballing career at the age of eight, when he began playing for a local club. As a child, he also played tennis,[7] and it was not until he moved on to São Paulo FC and signed his first professional contract with the club at the age of 15 that he chose to focus on football. In 2003, he joined Italian club Milan for a fee of €8.5 million. While at Milan, Kaká won a Serie A title and the UEFA Champions League, and in 2007 he received the FIFA World Player of the Year and Ballon d'Or awards. After his success with Milan, Kaká joined Real Madrid for a transfer fee of €65 million.[8] At the time, this was the second highest transfer fee (in euros) ever, behind only the €75 million fee for Zinedine Zidane. After four seasons in Spain, he returned to Milan for a season in 2013, scoring his 100th goal for the club. At the end of the 2013–14 season, he joined MLS expansion club Orlando City, but initially returned to his former Brazilian club São Paulo FC on loan. In 2015, he scored on his MLS debut for Orlando City; he was later included in the roster for the 2015 MLS All-Star Game, where he was named Most Valuable Player.","At international level, Kaká made his debut for the Brazil national team in 2002, and was selected for their victorious World Cup squad that year, as well as the 2006 and 2010 tournaments. He was also a member of Brazil's 2005 and 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup-winning squads, winning the Golden Ball Award in the 2009 edition, as the tournament's best player.","In addition to his contributions on the pitch, Kaká is known for his humanitarian work. In 2004, by the time of his appointment, he became the youngest ambassador of the UN World Food Programme.[9] For his contributions on and off the pitch, Kaká was named in the Time 100 list of the world's most influential people in 2008 and 2009.[10] Kaká was the first sportsperson to amass 10 million followers on Twitter.[11]","Kaká is currently the highest paid player in the MLS, with total earnings of $7,167,500, and a $6.6 million base salary.[12]",,,"Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite was born in Gama, Brazil, to Bosco Izecson Pereira Leite (a civil engineer) and Simone dos Santos (an elementary school teacher).[13] He had a financially secure upbringing that allowed him to focus on both school and football at the same time.[14] His younger brother Rodrigo (best known as Digão) and cousin Eduardo Delani are also professional footballers. Digão called him ""Caca"" due to his inability to pronounce ""Ricardo"" when they were young; it eventually evolved into Kaká.[15] The word has no specific Portuguese translation.[16]","When he was seven, Kaká's family moved to São Paulo.[17] His school had arranged him in a local youth club called ""Alphaville,"" who qualified to the final in a local tournament.[18] There he was discovered by hometown club São Paulo FC, who offered him a place in the youth academy.[19]","At the age of 18, Kaká suffered a career-threatening and possibly paralysis-inducing spinal fracture as a result of a swimming pool accident,[20][21] but remarkably made a full recovery. He attributes his recovery to God and has since tithed his income to his church.[21]","Kaká began his career with São Paulo at the age of eight. He signed a contract at 15 and led the São Paulo youth squad to Copa de Juvenil glory. He made his senior side debut on 1 February 2001 and scored 12 goals in 27 appearances, in addition to leading São Paulo to its first and only Torneio Rio-São Paulo championship, in which he scored two goals in two minutes as a substitute against Botafogo in the final, which São Paulo won 2–1.","He scored ten goals in 22 matches the following season, and by this time his performance was soon attracting attention from European clubs.[22] Kaká made a total of 58 appearances for São Paulo, scoring 23 times.[23]","The steady European interest in Kaká culminated in his signing with the European champions, Italian club A.C. Milan, in 2003 for a fee of €8.5 million, described in retrospect as ""peanuts"" by club owner Silvio Berlusconi.[24] Within a month, he cracked the starting lineup, replacing Rui Costa in the attacking midfield playmaking position, behind strikers Jon Dahl Tomasson, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko. His Serie A debut was in a 2–0 win over Ancona. He scored ten goals in 30 appearances that season, also providing several important assists, such as the cross which led to Shevchenko's title-deciding headed goal, as Milan won the Scudetto and the UEFA Super Cup, whilst finishing as runner up in the Intercontinental Cup and the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana.[25] Milan also reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to eventual winners Lazio, and were knocked out of the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Deportivo de La Coruña. Due to his performances in his debut season, in 2004, Kaká was named Serie A Footballer of the Year, and was nominated for both the Ballon d'Or (finishing in 15th place) and the FIFA World Player of the Year Awards (finishing in ninth place).","Kaká was a part of the five-man midfield in the 2004–05 season, usually playing in a withdrawn role behind striker Andriy Shevchenko. He was supported by Gennaro Gattuso and Clarence Seedorf defensively, as well as Massimo Ambrosini, allowing Kaká as the attacking midfielder and Rui Costa or Andrea Pirlo as the deep-lying playmaker to be in charge of creating Milan's goalscoring chances, forming a formidable midfield unit in both Italy and Europe. Milan began the season by winning the Supercoppa Italiana against Lazio. He scored seven goals in 36 domestic appearances as Milan finished runner-up in the Scudetto race. Milan also reached the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia that season. Kaká played a pivotal role in Milan's Champions League campaign that season, helping them to reach the final against Liverpool, scoring two goals and providing five assists. Dubbed the ""Miracle of Istanbul,"" Milan led 3–0 at half time, before Liverpool staged a comeback, scoring three goals in six minutes, and eventually won the match 3–2 on penalties.[26] A match widely regarded as one of the greatest finals in the competition's history, Kaká was imperious in the first half; he first won the early free-kick which led to Paolo Maldini's opening goal, later beginning the play that led to Hernán Crespo's first goal and Milan's second of the night, before executing a long curling pass that split open the Liverpool defence and rolled perfectly into the path of Crespo to score Milan's third.[26][27][28] Kaká was once again nominated for the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year Awards, finishing ninth and eighth respectively, and he was named the 2005 UEFA Club Football Best Midfielder.","The 2005–06 season saw Kaká score his first hat-tricks in domestic competitions. On 9 April 2006, he scored his first Rossoneri hat-trick against Chievo, with all three goals scored in the second half.[29] Milan were knocked out in the semi-finals of the 2005–06 Champions League to eventual champions Barcelona, and were once again eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia. Milan also finished once again as runners-up in Serie A, with Kaká scoring 17 goals in the league. After the 2006 Calciopoli scandal, however, Milan were deducted 30 points, which placed them in third in the table. Kaká was nominated for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year Awards for the third consecutive year, finishing 11th and seventh respectively. He was also selected to be part of both the UEFA Team of the Year[30] and the FIFPro World XI for the first time in his career.","Andriy Shevchenko's departure to Chelsea for the 2006–07 season allowed Kaká to become the focal point of Milan's offense as he alternated between the midfield and forward positions, operating at times as a striker or as a second striker behind Filippo Inzaghi, as well as in his more typical attacking midfield position. On 2 November 2006, he scored his first Champions League hat-trick in a 4–1 group stage win over the Belgian side Anderlecht.[31] He finished as the top scorer in the 2006–07 Champions League campaign with ten goals.[32] One of the goals helped the Rossoneri eliminate Celtic in the round of 16, 1–0 on aggregate,[33] and he scored three goals against Manchester United in the semi-finals.[34][35] Milan also reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia that season, losing out to winners Roma, and finished fourth in Serie A.","Kaká won the Champions League title when Milan defeated Liverpool 2–1 on 23 May 2007, avenging the previous loss on penalties two years before. Though he went scoreless, he won a free kick that led to the first of Filippo Inzaghi's two goals, and provided the assist for the second.[36] For his stellar play throughout the competition, he was voted the Vodafone Fans' Player of the Season in a poll of over 100,000 UEFA.com visitors. On 30 August, Kaká was named by UEFA as both the top forward of the 2006–07 Champions League season and UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, as well as being named as part of the UEFA Team of the Year for the second time.[37][38] He once again finished as the second-best assist-provider of the Champions League, providing five, and was voted the 2007 IFFHS World's Best Playmaker.[39]","Milan began its 2007–08 season by winning the UEFA Super Cup on 31 August, defeating Sevilla 3–1, with Kaká scoring the third goal.[40] Kaká had made a dribbling run into Sevilla's area, winning a penalty, which he then proceeded to take. Although it was saved by goalkeeper Andrés Palop, Kaká scored on the rebound with a header. Kaká had previously hit the post in the first half.[41] He played his 200th career match with Milan in a 1–1 home draw with Catania on 30 September, scoring from a penalty,[42] and on 5 October, he was named the 2006–07 FIFPro World Player of the Year, and was elected as part of the FIFPro World XI.

In English, Inquilab Zindabad means ""Long live the revolution."" However, at the suggestion of fellow poet Sumitranandan Pant, Harivansh Rai changed the boy's name to Amitabh, which means ""the light that will never die.""[citation needed] Although his surname was Shrivastava, Amitabh's father had adopted the pen name Bachchan (""child-like"" in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all of his works.[citation needed] It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films and for all other practical purposes, Bachchan has become the surname for all of his immediate family.[citation needed] Bachchan's father died in 2003, and his mother in 2007.[22]","Bachchan is an alumnus of Sherwood College, Nainital.

Bachchan then played the leading role in film Majboor, released on 6 December 1974, which was a remake of the Hollywood film Zig Zag. The film was a success at the box office.[30] In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres from the comedy Chupke Chupke, the crime drama Faraar to the romantic drama Mili. 1975 was also the year when Bachchan appeared in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history. He starred in the Yash Chopra directed film Deewaar along with Shashi Kapoor, Nirupa Roy, and Neetu Singh, earning him a Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number 4.[31] Indiatimes Movies ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films.[32] Released on 15 August 1975 was Sholay, which became the highest-grossing film of 1975 and also of all time in India, earning INR 2,364,500,000 equivalent to US$60 million, after adjusting for inflation.[33] in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. In 1999, BBC India declared it the ""Film of the Millennium"" and like Deewar, has been cited by Indiatimes movies as amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films.[32] In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years.","In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic family drama Kabhie Kabhie. Bachchan starred as a young poet named Amit Malhotra who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja (Rakhee Gulzar) who ends up marrying someone else (Shashi Kapoor). The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his ""angry young man"" roles like Zanjeer and Deewar. The film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike. Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film. That same year he played a double role in Adalat as father and son. In 1977, he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Amar Akbar Anthony where he played the third lead opposite Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest-grossing film of that year. His other successes that year include Parvarish and Khoon Pasina.[34] He once again resumed double roles in films such as Kasme Vaade (1978) as Amit and Shankar and Don (1978) playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look alike Vijay. His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. He also gave towering performances in Yash Chopra's Trishul and Prakash Mehra's Muqaddar Ka Sikandar both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations.","In 1979, Bachchan starred in Suhaag which was the highest earning film of that year. In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like Mr. Natwarlal, Kaala Patthar and The Great Gambler. Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film Mr. Natwarlal in which he starred with Rekha. Bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer. He also received Best Actor nomination for Kaala Patthar and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the Raj Khosla directed film Dostana, in which he starred opposite Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman. Dostana proved to be the top-grossing film of 1980.[35] In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film Silsila, where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and Rekha. Other films of this period like Shaan (1980), Shakti (1982) which pitted him against the veteran actor Dilip Kumar were not successful at the box office but Ram Balram (1980), Naseeb (1981) and Lawaaris (1981) were successful.[36]",In 1982 he played double roles in the films Satte Pe Satta and Desh Premee which succeeded at the box office.[37] In 1983 he played a triple role in Mahaan and starred in the top-grossing film of that year Coolie.[38],"On 26 July 1982, while filming Coolie,in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor Puneet Issar.[39] Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic rupture from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death. The public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating.[40]","Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success and the top-grossing film that year.[41]","The director, Manmohan Desai, altered the ending of Coolie after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.[42]","Later, he was diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis. His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received and stated before every release, ""Yeh film to flop hogi!"" (""This film will flop"").[43]","In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend, Rajiv Gandhi. He contested Allahabad's seat of 8th Lok Sabha against H. N. Bahuguna, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and won by one of the highest victory margins in general election history (68.2% of the vote).[44] His political career, however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a cesspool. The resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the ""Bofors scandal"" by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court.[45] Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal[citation needed].","His old friend, Amar Singh, helped him during the financial crisis caused by the failure of his company, ABCL. Thereafter Bachchan started supporting the Samajwadi Party, the political party to which Amar Singh belonged. Furthermore, Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi party and represented the party as an MP in the Rajya Sabha.[46] Bachchan has continued to do favours for the Samajwadi party, including appearing in advertisements and political campaigns. These activities have recently got him into trouble in the Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer.[47]","A 15-year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by Stardust and some of the other film magazines. In his defence, Bachchan claimed to have banned the press from entering his sets until late 1989.[48]","In 1988, Bachchan returned to films, playing the title role in Shahenshah, which was a box office success.[49] After the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films like Jaadugar, Toofan and Main Azaad Hoon (all released in 1989) failed at the box office. The 1991 hit film, Hum, for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award, looked like it might reverse the trend, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued. Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 film Agneepath. These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time. After the release of Khuda Gawah in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. With the exception of the delayed release of Insaniyat (1994), which was also a box office failure, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years.[50]","Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up Amitabh Bachchan Corporation, Ltd. (ABCL) in 1996, with a vision of becoming a 10 billion rupees (approx. U.S. $250 M) premier entertainment company by the year 2000.[citation needed] ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of India's entertainment industry. ABCL's operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, and celebrity and event management.[citation needed] Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film it produced was Tere Mere Sapne, which did not fare well at the boxoffice but launched the careers of actors like Arshad Warsi and South films star Simran.[citation needed] ABCL produced a few other films, none of which did well.[citation needed]","In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film Mrityudata, produced by ABCL. Though Mrityudaata attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically.[citation needed] ABCL was the main sponsor of the 1996 Miss World beauty pageant, Bangalore but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997. The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by Indian Industries board.[citation needed] The Bombay high court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay bungalow 'Prateeksha' and two flats till the pending loan recovery cases of Canara Bank were disposed of. Bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company.[51]","Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career and had average success with Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998),[50] and received positive reviews for Sooryavansham (1999)[52] but other films such as Lal Baadshah (1999) and Hindustan Ki Kasam (1999) were box office failures.","In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in Yash Chopra's box-office hit, Mohabbatein, directed by Aditya Chopra. He played a stern, older figure that rivalled the character of Shahrukh Khan. His role won him his third Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love (2001), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Baghban (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in Aks (2001), Aankhen (2002), Khakee (2004) and Dev (2004). His performance in Aks won him his first Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Black (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an ageing teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor, his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award and his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the hit films Bunty Aur Babli (2005), the Godfather tribute Sarkar (2005), and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). All of them were successful at the box office.[53][54] His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were Baabul (2006),[55] Ekalavya and Nishabd (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics.[56]","In May 2007, two of his films Cheeni Kum and the multi-starrer Shootout at Lokhandwala were released. Shootout at Lokhandwala did well at the box office and was declared a semi-hit in India, while Cheeni Kum picked up after a slow start and only had average success.[57] A remake of his biggest hit, Sholay (1975), entitled Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag, released in August of that same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical reception.[57] The year also marked Bachchan's first appearance in an English-language film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, co-starring Arjun Rampal and Preity Zinta. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 2007. He received positive reviews from critics who hailed his performance as his best ever since Black.[58] Bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in his first international film, Shantaram, directed by Mira Nair and starring Hollywood actor Johnny Depp in the lead. The film was due to begin filming in February 2008 but due to the writer's strike, was pushed to September 2008.[59] The film is currently ""shelved"" indefinitely.[60] Vivek Sharma's Bhoothnath, in which he plays the title role as a ghost, was released on 9 May 2008. Sarkar Raj, the sequel of the 2005 film Sarkar, released in June 2008 and received a positive response at the box-office. Paa, which released at the end of 2009 was a highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son Abhishek's Progeria-affected 13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards Bachchan's performance. It won him his third National Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Best Actor Award. In 2010, he debuted in Malayalam film through Kandahar, directed by Major Ravi and co-starring Mohanlal.[61] The film was based on the hijacking incident of the Indian Airlines Flight 814.[62] Bachchan declined any remuneration for this film.[63] In 2013 he made his Hollywood debut in The Great Gatsby making a special appearance opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. In 2014, he played the role of the friendly ghost in the sequel Bhoothnath Returns. The next year, he played the role of a grumpy father suffering from chronic constipation in Piku. It won him his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor and his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Bachchan will next appear in Ram Gopal Varma's Sarkar 3. He has also committed to starring in Thugs Of Hindostan with Aamir Khan.[64]","In 2000, Bachchan hosted the first season of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), the Indian adaptation of the British television game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The show was well received.[65] A second season followed in 2005 but its run was cut short by STAR Plus when Bachchan fell ill in 2006.[66]","In 2009, Bachchan hosted the third season of the reality show Bigg Boss.[67]","In 2010, Bachchan hosted the fourth season of KBC.[68] The fifth season started on 15 August 2011 and ended on 17 November 2011.

National_Basketball_Association,United States:,Canada:,"The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the major men's professional basketball league in North America, and is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. It has 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada), and is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[2] which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.[3][4]","The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[1][5] The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with its rival National Basketball League (NBL). The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.",,,"The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now regards as the first played in its history.[6] The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.[7]","Following the 1948–49 season, the BAA took in the remainder of the NBL: Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed from the BAA to the National Basketball Association in spite of having the same BAA governing body including Podoloff.[7] The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,[8] as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953–54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors, Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, Fort Wayne Pistons, Tri-Cities Blackhawks, and Syracuse Nationals, all of which remain in the league today. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951, and then to St. Louis in 1955. The Rochester Royals moved from Rochester, New York, to Cincinnati in 1957 and the Pistons relocated from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Detroit in 1957.","Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950.[9][10] Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,[9][11] but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel ""Sweetwater"" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league's first dynasty.[12] To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954.[13] If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.","In 1957, rookie center Bill Russell joined the Boston Celtics, who already featured guard Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, and went on to lead the club to eleven NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center Wilt Chamberlain entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single game records in scoring (100) and rebounding (55). Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports.","The 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from 1959 to 1966. This championship streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in 1966–67, but regained it in the 1967–68 season and repeated in 1969. The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.[14]","Through this period, the NBA continued to strengthen with the shift of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers, and the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta, as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now Washington Wizards) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the Chicago Bulls, Seattle SuperSonics (now Oklahoma City Thunder), San Diego Rockets (who relocated to Houston four years later), Milwaukee Bucks, and Phoenix Suns.","In 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, Rick Barry, jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran referees—Norm Drucker, Earl Strom, John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.[15]","In 1969, Alan Siegel, who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's Major League Baseball logo a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of the legendary Jerry West based on a photo by Wen Roberts, although NBA officials denied a particular player as being its influence because, according to Siegel, ""They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player."" The iconic logo debuted in 1971 and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.[16][17]","The ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including Julius Erving of the Virginia Squires, in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period, one purpose being to tie up the most viable cities. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the Portland Trail Blazers, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Buffalo Braves (now the Los Angeles Clippers) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17.[18] The New Orleans Jazz (now in Utah) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 1976 season, the leagues reached a settlement that provided for the addition of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and New York Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Rick Barry, Dave Cowens, Julius Erving, Elvin Hayes, Walt Frazier, Moses Malone, Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, Dan Issel, and Pete Maravich. The end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player issues – both perceived and real – that threatened to derail the NBA.","The league added the ABA's innovative three-point field goal beginning in 1979 to open up the game. That same year, rookies Larry Bird and Magic Johnson joined the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers respectively, initiating a period of significant growth in fan interest in the NBA throughout the country and the world. In 1984, they played against each other for the first time in the NBA Finals. Johnson went on to lead the Lakers to five titles, and Bird went on to lead the Celtics to three. Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the Dallas Mavericks, bringing the total to 23 teams. Later on, Larry Bird won the first three three-point shooting contests. Former league commissioner David Stern who took office on February 1, 1984 before retiring February 1, 2014, oversaw the expansion and growth of the NBA to a global commodity.","Michael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls, providing an even more popular star to support growing interest in the league. This resulted in more cities demanding teams of their own. In 1988 and 1989, four cities got their wishes as the Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, and Minnesota Timberwolves made their NBA debuts, bringing the total to 27 teams. In the first year of the 1990s, the Detroit Pistons would win the second of their back-to-back titles, led by coach Chuck Daly and guard Isiah Thomas. Jordan and Scottie Pippen would lead the Bulls to two three-peats in eight years during the 1991–98 seasons. Hakeem Olajuwon won back-to-back titles with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995.","The 1992 Olympic basketball Dream Team, the first to use current NBA stars, featured Michael Jordan as the anchor, along with Bird, Johnson, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Chris Mullin, Charles Barkley, and Christian Laettner. Eleven players on the Dream Team have been inducted individually into the Basketball Hall of Fame.","In 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the addition of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors. In 2001, the Vancouver Grizzlies relocated to Memphis, which left the Raptors as the only Canadian team in the NBA.","In 1996, the NBA created a women's league, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).","In 1998, the NBA owners began a lockout which lasted 191 days and was settled on January 18, 1999. As a result of this lockout the 1998–99 NBA season was reduced from 82 to 50 games (61% of a normal season), and the All-Star Game was cancelled. The San Antonio Spurs won their first championship, and first by a former ABA team, by beating the New York Knicks, who were the first, and are the only, eighth seed to ever make it to the NBA Finals.","Since the breakup of the Chicago Bulls championship roster in the summer of 1998, the Western Conference has dominated, with the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs combining to win the title nine out of fourteen seasons. Tim Duncan and David Robinson won the 1999 championship with the Spurs, and Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant started the 2000s with three consecutive championships for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in 2003 against the Nets. In 2004, the Lakers returned to the Finals, only to fall in five games to the Detroit Pistons.","After the Spurs took home the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in 2005, the 2006 Finals featured two franchises making their inaugural Finals appearances. The Miami Heat, led by their star shooting guard, Dwyane Wade, and Shaquille O'Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during the 2004 summer, won the series over the Dallas Mavericks in six after losing the first two games. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were led by LeBron James. The 2008 Finals saw a rematch of the league's highest profile rivalry, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, with the Celtics winning, for their 17th championship, thanks to their new big three of Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett.","In 2009, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers returned to the Finals, this time defeating the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic.[19] Bryant won his first Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his 13th season after leading the Lakers to their first NBA championship since the departure of Shaquille O'Neal.[20]","The 2010 NBA All-Star Game was held at Cowboys Stadium in front of the largest crowd ever, 108,713.[21] At the end of that season, the Celtics and the Lakers renewed their rivalry from 2008 when they met again in the NBA Finals for a record 12th time. The Lakers won the title by winning Game 7, 83–79.[22] Before the start of the 2010–11 season the NBA had an exciting summer with one of the most anticipated free agent classes of all time. Two of which signed, and one resigned, with the Miami Heat, leading to a season that was heavily centered on their eventual success or failure at taking home the championship. The Heat, led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, did in fact make the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, in a rematch for the franchises of the 2006 Finals. The Mavericks, led by Dirk Nowitzki (the eventual NBA Finals MVP), took the series in six games. This was the Mavericks' first title. Veterans Shawn Marion, Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, and Peja Stojaković celebrated their first NBA championship.","On July 1, 2011, at 12:01 am, the NBA announced another lockout.[23] After the first few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a shortened 66-game season.[24] Following the shortened season, the Miami Heat made a return to the Finals with the trio of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh against Oklahoma City Thunder's Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden. The Heat went on to defeat the Thunder in five games, capturing their second NBA title in six years. Their success would continue into the following season, which concluded with their victory over the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals. The two teams would meet for a rematch in the following year's Finals, where the Spurs defeated the Heat in five games. Following that series, LeBron James announced that he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. James led the Cavaliers to their second Finals appearance, where they fell to the Golden State Warriors in six games. Most recently, in a rematch, the 2016 NBA Finals concluded with the Cavaliers defeating the Warriors in seven games to win their first NBA Championship.","Following pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dražen Petrović (Croatia) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Since 2006, the NBA has faced EuroLeague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour, and since 2009, in the EuroLeague American Tour. The 2013–14 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league[25]","In 2001, an affiliated minor league, the National Basketball Development League, now called the NBA Development League (or D-League) was created.[26] Before the league was started, there were strong rumors that the NBA would purchase the Continental Basketball Association, and call it its developmental league.","Two years after the Hornets' relocation to New Orleans, the NBA returned to North Carolina, as the Charlotte Bobcats were formed as an expansion team in 2004.",The Hornets temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City in 2005 for two seasons because of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. The team returned to New Orleans in 2007.,"A new official game ball was introduced on June 28, 2006, for the 2006–07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons.[27] Manufactured by Spalding, the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet.","Commissioner Stern announced on December 11, 2006, that beginning January 1, 2007, the NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to the 2006–07 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball.[28] The Players' Association had filed a suit in behalf of the players against the NBA over the new ball.[29] As of 2006, the NBA team jerseys are manufactured by Adidas, which purchased the previous supplier, Reebok.","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation on July 19, 2007, over allegations that veteran NBA referee Tim Donaghy bet on basketball games he officiated over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the point spread in those games.[30] On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. However, he could face additional charges if it is determined that he deliberately miscalled individual games. Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain refs were friendly with players and ""company men"" for the NBA. Donaghy alleged that refs influenced the outcome of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner David Stern denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a ""singing, cooperating witness"".[31] Donaghy served 15 months in prison and was released in November 2009.[32] According to an independent study by Ronald Beech of Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings, although the refs increased the Lakers' chances of winning through foul calls during the game, there was no collusion to fix the game. On alleged ""star treatment"" during Game 6 by the refs toward certain players, Beech claimed, ""there does seem to be issues with different standards and allowances for different players."" [33]","The NBA Board of Governors approved the request of the Seattle SuperSonics to relocate to Oklahoma City on April 18, 2008.[34] The team, however, could not move until it had settled a lawsuit filed by the city of Seattle, which was intended to keep the SuperSonics in Seattle for the remaining two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena. Following a court case, the city of Seattle settled with the ownership group of the SuperSonics on July 2, 2008, allowing the team to move to Oklahoma City immediately in exchange for terminating the final two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena.[35] The Oklahoma City Thunder began playing in the 2008–09 season.","The first outdoor game in the modern era of the league was played at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden on October 11, 2008, between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets.[36]","A referee lockout began on September 1, 2009, when the contract between the NBA and its referees expired. The first preseason games were played on October 1, 2009, and replacement referees from the WNBA and NBA Development League were used, the first time replacement referees had been used since the beginning of the 1995–96 season.[37] The NBA and the regular referees reached a deal on October 23, 2009.[38]","The first official NBA league games on European ground took place in 2011. In two matchups, the New Jersey Nets faced the Toronto Raptors at the O2 Arena in London in front of over 20,000 fans.",The NBA laid off around 114 league employees—about 11 percent of all the league office workforce—in July 2011 to save money.[39],"The 2011–12 NBA season, scheduled to begin November 1, 2011, with a matchup between the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls, was postponed due to a labor dispute. The lockout officially ended on December 8, 2011, when players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement, and the season began on Christmas Day.","The New Jersey Nets officially changed their name to the Brooklyn Nets on April 30, 2012.[40] They began playing in the New York City borough of Brooklyn in the 2012–13 season.",The NBA announced in October 2012 that it would begin fining players for flopping.[41][42],"After the 2012–13 season, the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans.[43] During the 2013–14 season, Stern retired as commissioner after 30 years, and deputy commissioner Adam Silver ascended to the position of commissioner. During that season's playoffs, the Bobcats officially reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from the Pelicans' time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated as a 2002 expansion team.[44] (This is somewhat similar to the relationship between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the NFL.)","Donald Sterling, who was then-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, received a lifetime ban from the NBA on April 29, 2014, after racist remarks he made became public. Sterling was also fined US$2.5 million, the maximum allowed under the NBA Constitution.[45]","Becky Hammon was hired by the San Antonio Spurs on August 5, 2014, as an assistant coach, becoming the second female coach in NBA history but the first full-time coach.[46][47] This also makes her the first full-time female coach in any of the four major professional sports in North America.[47]","The NBA announced on April 15, 2016, that it would allow all 30 of its member clubs to sell corporate sponsor advertisement patches on official game uniforms, beginning with the 2017–18 season. The sponsorship advertisement patches would appear on the left front of jerseys, opposite Nike's logo, and would measure approximately 2.5 by 2.5 inches. The NBA will become the first major North American professional sports league to allow corporate sponsorship logos on official team uniforms.[48] The first team to announce a jersey sponsorship was the Philadelphia 76ers, who agreed to a deal with StubHub.[49]","The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.","The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.","Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA development league. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.","During the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).","The NBA is one of only two of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in which teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being the National Hockey League). Each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team.","The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day.[50] The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947,[51] though the first Christmas Day games were not televised until 1983–84.[52] Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players.[50][51][52] Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season.[51][52] Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.","In February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters at each position in each conference are given a starting spot on their conference's All-Star team. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, Eastern conference players face the Western conference players in the All-Star game. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest, where players compete to score the most amount of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.","Shortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm Eastern Time.[53][54] After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.","Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.","The post-season teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.","NBA Playoffs begin in late April, with eight teams in each conference competing for the Championship. The three division winners, along with the team with the next best record from the conference are given the top four seeds. The next four teams in terms of record are given the lower four seeds.","Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. This means that, for example, if the team who receives the 6 seed has a better record than the team with the 3 seed (by virtue of a divisional championship), the 6 seed would have home court advantage, even though the other team has a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the Denver Nuggets won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the #3 seed. Their opponent was the #6 seed Los Angeles Clippers, who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in 5.","The playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the 1st and 8th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 4th and 5th seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the 2nd and 7th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 3rd and 6th seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the NBA Finals followed a 2–3–2 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.[55]","The final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the NBA Finals, and is held annually in June. The victor in the NBA Finals wins the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general manager—on the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award to the best performing player of the series.","On August 2, 2006, the NBA announced the new playoff format. The new format takes the three division winners and the second-place team with the best record and rank them 1–4 by record. The other 4 slots are filled by best record other than those other 4 teams.[56] Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.","The Boston Celtics have won the most championships with 17 NBA Finals wins. The second most successful franchise is the Los Angeles Lakers, who have 16 overall championships (11 in Los Angeles, 5 in Minneapolis). Following the Lakers, are the Chicago Bulls with six championships, all won over an 8-year span during the 1990s, and the San Antonio Spurs with five championships, all since 1999.",Current teams that have no NBA Finals appearances:,"As one of the major sports leagues in North America, the National Basketball Association has a long history of partnership with television networks in the United States. The League signed a contract with DuMont in its 8th season (1953–54), marking the first year the NBA had a national television broadcaster. Similar to NFL, the lack of television stations leads to NBC taking over the rights beginning the very next season until April 7, 1962 - NBC's first tenure with the NBA. Currently in the U.S., the NBA has a contract with ESPN and TNT through the 2024–25 season. Games that are not broadcast nationally are usually aired over regional sports network specific to the area where the teams are located.",The National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions. From 1987 to 1999 the NBA champions played against the continental champions of the Fédération Internationale de Basketball (FIBA) in the McDonald's Championship. This tournament was won by the NBA invitee every year it was held.[57],"In 2012, a ticket cost from $10 to $3,000 apiece, depending on the location of the seat and the success of the teams that were playing.[58]","According to Nielsen's survey, the NBA has the youngest audience, with 45 percent of its viewers under 35, but the least likely, along with Major League Baseball, to be watched by women, who make up only 30% of the viewership. It also has the highest share of black viewers with 45 percent of its viewers being black and only about 40 percent of viewers being white, making it the only top North American sport that doesn't have a white majority audience.[59]","Following pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dražen Petrović (Croatia) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Below is a short list of foreign players who have won NBA awards or have been otherwise recognized for their contributions to basketball, either currently or formerly active in the league:","On some occasions, young players, most but not all from the English-speaking world, have attended U.S. colleges before playing in the NBA. Notable examples are:","Since 2006, the NBA has faced EuroLeague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour, and since 2009 in the EuroLeague American Tour.","The 2013–14 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league[25] The NBA defines ""international"" players as those born outside the 50 United States and Washington, D.C.

As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khawani Bazaar.[11] Meer was a follower of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[14] and affiliated with the All Indian National Congress.[11] He moved to New Delhi in 1948 partition of India.[15] Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[16][b] His parents were married in 1959.[19] Khan described himself on Twitter as ""half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), [and] some Kashmiri (grandmother)"".[20] His paternal cousins in Peshawar claim that the family is of Hindkowan origin from Kashmir, not Pashtun, and also contradict the claim that his grandfather was from Afghanistan.[11][21]","Khan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of Delhi.[22] His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments.[23] Khan attended St. Columba's School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football,[24] and received the school's highest award, the Sword of Honour.[23] In his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan and Mumtaz.[25] One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress.[26] Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor's degree in Economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi's Theatre Action Group (TAG),[27] where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John.[28] After Hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in Mass Communications at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career.[29] He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.[30] His father died of cancer in 1981,[c] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.[33] After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh, born in 1960,[34] fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her.[31][35] Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.[36]","Although Khan was given the birth name Shahrukh Khan, he prefers his name to be written as Shah Rukh Khan, and is commonly referred to by the acronym SRK.[1] He married Gauri Chibber, a Punjabi Hindu, in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991, after a six-year courtship.[37][38] They have a son Aryan (born 1997) and a daughter Suhana (born 2000).[29] In 2013, they became parents of a third child named AbRam,[39] who was born through a surrogate mother.[40] According to Khan, while he strongly believes in Islam, he also values his wife's religion. His children follow both religions; at home the Qur'an is situated next to the Hindu deities.[41]","Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[42] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[43][44] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1991).[45] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[45] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[46] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[47] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[45][48]","Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[49] citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death.[50] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood, and was quickly signed to four films.[49] His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[30][43] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[51] His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[52] In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood career;[53] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.[54] Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[55] His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was ""sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.""[56]","Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: an obsessive lover in Darr, and a murderer in Baazigar.[57] Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase ""I love you, K-k-k-Kiran"" were popular with audiences.[58] For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.[59] Baazigar, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.[60] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character ""the consummate anti-hero"".[61] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[62] In 2003, the Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan ""defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero"".[62] Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.[63] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.[64]","In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah's comedy-drama film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan's best performance, saying ""He is spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart.""[65] Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit and Deepak Tijori.[62] At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man's career in Bollywood. Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking ""insane risks"" and ""pushing the envelope"" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career in Bollywood.[56] The director Mukul S. Anand called him ""the new face of the industry"" at the time.[50]","Khan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India.[66] His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a ""romantic hero"".[67] Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an ""all time blockbuster"" by Box Office India,[66][68] with a gross of over ₹1.22 billion (US$19 million) worldwide.[69] It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015.[70][71] The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards.[62] The director and critic Raja Sen said, ""Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.""[72]","In 1996, all four of Khan's releases failed critically and commercially,[73] but the following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy Yes Boss earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination.[59] Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai's diasporic-themed social drama Pardes,[74] portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States.[75] Khan's final release of 1997 was a second collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai. He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor. The film and his performance met with critical praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare.[62]","Khan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre in Mahesh Bhatt's action comedy Duplicate, the first of his many collaborations with Yash Johar's production company Dharma Productions. The film was not well received,[76] but India Today lauded Khan for his energetic performance.[77] The same year, Khan won critical praise for his performance as an All India Radio correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (Manisha Koirala) in Dil Se..,[78] the third instalment of Mani Ratnam's trilogy of terror films.[79][80] In his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in Karan Johar's romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as the blockbuster of the 1990s, a ""pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment.""[81] Khan won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second consecutive year,[62] although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol.[82]","The roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers,[83] and according to author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India.[84][85] He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar.[86] Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars,[84] although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.[87]","Khan's only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office,[88] it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi.[59] Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited.[89] The company's first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure.[90] It was released one week after Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan.[91] Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying ""Frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little.""[92] Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan.[93] He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Kamal Haasan.[94][95] On Khan's performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, ""Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.""[93]","In 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the title role in Santosh Sivan's historical epic Aśoka, a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response,[96] but it performed poorly at Indian box offices.[97] As losses continued to mount for the production company,[91] Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited.[98] In December 2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsi's Shakti: The Power.[99] He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted multiple alternative therapies. None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films.[99][100] By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital, London.[101][102][103] Khan resumed shooting in June 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually.[100]","Successes during this time included Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein (2000), and Karan Johar's family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001),[90][104] which Khan cites as a turning point in his career.[105] Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men.[106][107] Khan's performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Mohabbatein.[59][108] Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.[69]","In 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya Rai in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romance Devdas. At a cost of over ₹500 million (US$7.7 million), it was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time,[109] yet recovered its costs, earning ₹840 million (US$13 million) worldwide.[69] The film earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Khan,[54] and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[110] Khan next starred in Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), a comedy-drama written by Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year.[104][111] Co-starring with Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences.[112] Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production of Aziz Mirza's Chalte Chalte, and they parted ways, despite the film's success.[113]","2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer.[114] In the company's first production, he starred in Farah Khan's directorial debut, the action comedy masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain.[115] Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise.[116] It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$15 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$11 million).[69][117]","In his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a NASA scientist who patriotically returns to India to rekindle his roots in Ashutosh Gowariker's social drama Swades (meaning ""Homeland""), which became the first Indian picture to be shot inside the NASA research centre at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.[118] Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of ""Bollywoodised realism"", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in Hindi cinema.[119] In December 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film.[120] Derek Elley of Variety found Khan's performance ""unsettling"" as ""a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian peasants"",[121] but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date.[122][123] He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for Swades.[54][59] Filmfare later included his performance in the 2010 issue of Bollywood's ""Top 80 Iconic Performances"".[124]","In 2005, Khan starred in Amol Palekar's fantasy drama, Paheli. The film was India's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards.[125] He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), the story of two unhappily married people in New York City who begin an extramarital affair. The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Preity Zinta, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji and Kirron Kher, emerged as India's highest-grossing film in the overseas market,[104] earning more than ₹1.13 billion (US$17 million) worldwide.[69] Both his roles in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and the action film Don, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards,[126] despite his performance as the titular character in Don being negatively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.[127][128]","""Such great things have happened to such a normal guy like me. I am a nobody who shouldn't have been able to do all this but I have done it. I tell everyone that there's this myth I work for; there is this myth called Shahrukh Khan and I am his employee. I have to live up to that ... I'll do it, I am an actor. But I can't start believing in this myth.""","In 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coaches the Indian women's national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films' semi-fictional Chak De! India. Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university's hockey team,[130] essentially portrayed himself as a ""cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim"".[131] Faring well in both India and abroad,[69][132] Khan garnered another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance,[54] which Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considers to have been ""without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks"", portraying Kabir Khan ""like a real flesh-and-blood human being"".[133] Filmfare included his performance in their 2010 issue of the ""Top 80 Iconic Performances"".[134] In the same year, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone and Shreyas Talpade in Farah Khan's reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om, portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad.[104][135] Om Shanti Om earned Khan his second nomination of the year for Best Actor at Filmfare.[136] Khalid Mohammed from Hindustan Times wrote, ""the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature style—spontaneous and intuitively intelligent"".[137]","Khan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) opposite Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been ""tailor-made"" for Khan, giving him the opportunity to display his talents,[138] although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj.[139] In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009.[140][141] He performed an extended, special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khan—a fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone.[142] As head of the film's production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word ""barber"" was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.[143]","After refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol.[144] The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a ""symbol of assertive rasa values"" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood.[145] To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition.[146][147] Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India,[69][104] and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor,[54] equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar.[148] Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with ""averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts"", believing it to have been a ""standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval"".[149]","In 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in Anubhav Sinha's science fiction superhero film Ra.One, his first work in this genre, as a favour to his children.[150] The film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed as Bollywood's most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of ₹1.25 billion (US$19 million).[151][152] Despite negative media coverage of the film's box office performance, Ra.One was a financial success with a gross of ₹2.4 billion (US$37 million).[153][154] The film, and Khan's portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero G.One, they criticised his portrayal of the videogame designer Shekhar.[155] Khan's second release of 2011 was Don 2, a sequel to Don (2006).[156] To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively and performed most of the stunts himself.[157] His performance earned him positive reviews from critics; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India said, ""Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts"".[158] The year's highest grossing Bollywood production abroad,[159][160] it was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.[161]","Khan's only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra's last picture,[162] the drama Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that Khan's first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one.[87][163] Jab Tak Hai Jaan was a moderate financial success earning over ₹2.11 billion (US$33 million) worldwide.[164][165] The film was showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Veer-Zaara, and Don 2.[166] At the following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra's other past heroines.[167]","In 2013, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Chennai Express for Red Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and a fair amount of criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture, although the film included a tribute to Tamil cinema star Rajinikanth.[168] The critic Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for ""re-rendering every old trick in the acting book"".[169] Despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad, surpassing 3 Idiots to briefly become the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time, with a gross of almost ₹4 billion (US$62 million) in worldwide ticket sales.[170][171] On 7 March 2013—a day before International Women's Day—The Times of India reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success.[172] In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan's ensemble comedy Happy New Year, which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan and Boman Irani; his third collaboration with the director.[173] Although Khan's unidimensional character was criticised,[174] the film became a major commercial success grossing ₹3.8 billion (US$59 million) worldwide.[175][176][177]","Khan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty's comedy-drama Dilwale (2015). The film garnered negative reviews, though was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.9 billion (US$60 million).[178] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, ""With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer"". Joshi also felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired.[179] He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma's thriller Fan (2016). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be ""exhausting, bizarre yet watchable"" and thought that Khan was aptly ""creepy"" as the obsessive admirer.[180] The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to mainstream formula.[181] Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (played by Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde's coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi.[182]","In Rahul Dholakia's crime-drama film Raees (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-hero—a bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph thought Khan's performance to be ""inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms"".[183] Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning over ₹2.6 billion (US$40 million) worldwide.[184] As of February 2017, Khan is filming for Imtiaz Ali's untitled project opposite Anushka Sharma,[185] and has committed to star in Aanand L Rai's next project.[186][187]","Khan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited.[89] After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment,[114] which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising.[188] As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films.[189] Either Khan or Guari are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of Ra.One (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film's characters.[190][191] Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. In Josh (2000) he sang the popular song ""Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila"".

Emma_Watson,"Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990)[4] is a British actress, model, and activist. Born in Paris and brought up in Oxfordshire, Watson attended the Dragon School and trained as an actress at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts. She rose to prominence after landing her first professional acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series, having acted only in school plays previously.[5] Watson appeared in all eight Harry Potter films from 2001 to 2011, earning worldwide fame, critical accolades, and around $60 million.[6]","Watson continued to work outside of the Harry Potter films, lending her voice to The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and appearing in the 2007 television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes. Since then, she has taken on starring roles in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) and The Bling Ring (2013), made a brief appearance as an exaggerated version of herself in This Is the End (2013),[7] and portrayed the title character's adopted daughter in Noah (2014).[8] In 2017, she portrayed Belle in a live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. Her other releases include Regression (2015), Colonia (2015) and The Circle (2017).","From 2011 to 2014, Watson split her time between working on film projects and continuing her education, studying at Brown University and Worcester College, Oxford and graduating from Brown with a bachelor's degree in English literature in May 2014.[9] Her modelling work has included campaigns for Burberry and Lancôme.[10][11] As a fashion consultant, she helped create a line of clothing for People Tree.[12] She was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2014, winning for British Artist of the Year.[13] That same year, she was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate gender equality.[14]",,,"Watson was born in Paris, France, the daughter of English lawyers Jacqueline Luesby and Chris Watson.[4][15][16] Watson lived in Paris until the age of five. Her parents separated when she was young; following their divorce, Watson moved back to England to live with her mother in Oxfordshire while spending weekends at her father's house in London.[4][17] Watson has stated that she speaks some French, though ""not as well"" as she used to.[18] After moving to Oxford with her mother and brother, she attended the Dragon School in Oxford, remaining there until 2003.[4] From the age of six, she wanted to become an actress,[19] and trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing, and acting.[20]","By the age of ten, Watson had performed in various Stagecoach productions and school plays, including Arthur: The Young Years and The Happy Prince,[21] but she had never acted professionally before the Harry Potter series. Following the Dragon School, Watson moved on to Headington School.[4] While on film sets, she and her peers were tutored for up to five hours a day.[22] In June 2006, she took GCSE school examinations in ten subjects, achieving eight A* and two A grades.[4][23]","In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States), the film adaptation of British author J. K. Rowling's best-selling novel. Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher, and producers were impressed by her confidence. After eight auditions, producer David Heyman told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint that they had been cast for the roles of the schoolfriends Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, respectively. Rowling supported Watson from her first screen test.[19]","The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2001 was Watson's debut screen performance. The film broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001.[24][25] Critics praised the performances of the three leads, often singling out Watson for particular acclaim; The Daily Telegraph called her performance ""admirable"",[26] and IGN said she ""stole the show"".[27] Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in Philosopher's Stone, winning the Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actress.[28]","A year later, Watson again starred as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers praised the lead actors' performances. The Los Angeles Times said Watson and her peers had matured between films,[29] while The Times criticised director Chris Columbus for ""under-employing"" Watson's hugely popular character.[30] Watson received an Otto Award from the German magazine Bravo for her performance.[31]","In 2004, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released. Watson was appreciative of the more assertive role Hermione played, calling her character ""charismatic"" and ""a fantastic role to play"".[32] Although critics panned Radcliffe's performance, labelling him ""wooden"", they praised Watson; The New York Times lauded her performance, saying ""Luckily Mr. Radcliffe's blandness is offset by Ms. Watson's spiky impatience. Harry may show off his expanding wizardly skills ... but Hermione ... earns the loudest applause with a decidedly unmagical punch to Draco Malfoy's deserving nose.""[33] Although Prisoner of Azkaban proved to be the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film of the entire series, Watson's personal performance won her two Otto Awards and the Child Performance of the Year award from Total Film.[34][35]","With Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), both Watson and the Harry Potter film series reached new milestones. The film set records for a Harry Potter opening weekend, a non-May opening weekend in the US, and an opening weekend in the UK. Critics praised the increasing maturity of Watson and her teenage co-stars; The New York Times called her performance ""touchingly earnest"".[36] For Watson, much of the humour of the film sprang from the tension among the three lead characters as they matured. She said, ""I loved all the arguing. ... I think it's much more realistic that they would argue and that there would be problems.""[37] Nominated for three awards for Goblet of Fire, Watson won a bronze Otto Award.[38][39] Later that year, Watson became the youngest person to appear on the cover of Teen Vogue,[40] an appearance she reprised in August 2009.[41] In 2006, Watson played Hermione in The Queen's Handbag, a special mini-episode of Harry Potter in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday.[42]","The fifth film in the Harry Potter franchise, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released in 2007. A huge financial success, the film set a record worldwide opening-weekend gross of $332.7 million.[43] Watson won the inaugural National Movie Award for Best Female Performance.[44] As the fame of the actress and the series continued, Watson and fellow Harry Potter co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint left imprints of their hands, feet and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on 9 July 2007.[45]","By July 2007, Watson's work in the Harry Potter series was said to have earned her more than £10 million, and she acknowledged she would never have to work for money again.[46] In March 2009, she was ranked 6th on the Forbes list of ""Most Valuable Young Stars"",[47] and in February 2010, she was named as Hollywood's highest paid female star, having earned an estimated £19 million in 2009.[48]","Despite the success of Order of the Phoenix, the future of the Harry Potter franchise became surrounded in doubt, as all three lead actors were hesitant to sign on to continue their roles for the final two episodes.[49] Radcliffe eventually signed for the final films on 2 March 2007,[49] but Watson was considerably more hesitant.[50] She explained that the decision was significant, as the films represented a further four-year commitment to the role, but eventually conceded that she ""could never let [the role of] Hermione go"",[51] signing for the role on 23 March 2007.[52]","Watson's first non-Potter role was the 2007 BBC film Ballet Shoes, an adaptation of the novel of the same title by Noel Streatfeild.[53][54] The film's director, Sandra Goldbacher, commented that Watson was ""perfect"" for the starring role of aspiring actress Pauline Fossil: ""She has a piercing, delicate aura that makes you want to gaze and gaze at her.""[55] Ballet Shoes was broadcast in the UK on Boxing Day 2007 to an audience of 5.7 million viewers, to mixed reviews.[56][57][58]","Watson also lent her voice to the role of Princess Pea in the animated film The Tale of Despereaux, a children's comedy starring Matthew Broderick, with Harry Potter co-star Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid) also starring in the film.[59] The Tale of Despereaux was released in December 2008 and grossed $87 million worldwide.[60]","Principal photography for the sixth Harry Potter film began in late 2007, with Watson's part being filmed from 18 December to 17 May 2008.[61][62] Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince premiered on 15 July 2009,[63] having been delayed from November 2008.[64] With the lead actors now in their late teens, critics were increasingly willing to review them on the same level as the rest of the film's all-star cast, which the Los Angeles Times described as ""a comprehensive guide to contemporary UK acting"".[65] The Washington Post felt Watson to have given ""[her] most charming performance to date"",[66] while The Daily Telegraph described the lead actors as ""newly liberated and energised, eager to give all they have to what's left of the series"".[67] In December 2008, Watson stated she wanted to go to university after she completed the Potter series.[68]","Watson's filming for the final instalment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, began on 18 February 2009[69] and ended on 12 June 2010.[70] For financial and scripting reasons, the original book was divided into two films which were shot consecutively.[71][72] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 was released in November 2010 while the second film was released in July 2011.","She also appeared in a music video for One Night Only, after meeting lead singer George Craig at the 2010 Winter/Summer Burberry advertising campaign.

The film is based on the real-life Bling Ring robberies, with Watson playing a fictionalised version of Alexis Neiers, a television personality who was one of seven teenagers involved in the robberies. While the film mostly received mixed reviews, critics gave almost unanimous praise for Watson's portrayal of Nicki in the film. Watson also had a supporting role in the apocalyptic comedy This Is the End (2013), in which she, Seth Rogen, James Franco and many others played ""exaggerated versions of themselves""[7] and Watson memorably dropped the ""f-bomb"".[78] She said she could not pass up the opportunity to make her first comedy and ""work with some of the best comedians ... in the world right now"".[79]","In June 2012, Watson was confirmed for the role as Ila in Darren Aronofsky's Noah, which began filming the following month, and was released in March 2014.[8] In March 2013, it was reported that Watson was in negotiations to star as the title character in a live-action Disney adaptation of Cinderella.[80] Kenneth Branagh was attached to direct the adaptation, while Cate Blanchett had reportedly agreed to play the evil stepmother. Watson was offered the role, but turned it down because she did not resonate with the character.[81][82]","Watson was attached in 2012 to the role of Emma Forrest in a film adaptation of her memoir Your Voice in My Head. At the time, Harry Potter director David Yates was attached. In a May 2013 interview, it appeared that Watson was no longer attached as the film's star. Stanley Tucci stated that the role would instead be played by Emily Blunt.[83] However, by September 2013, it was confirmed that Watson was once again involved in the production in the role of Forrest and that filming would begin in November that year with a new director, Francesca Gregorini.[84]","As of June 2013, Watson is set to work with Harry Potter producer David Heyman for her next film Queen of the Tearling, based on a yet-to-be-released book trilogy. She will lead the film as heroine Kelsea Glynn as well as being an executive producer.[85] Warner Bros. will distribute the film.[86] It was reported in September 2013 that Watson would star in While We're Young, the film adaptation of Adena Halpern's 2010 novel 29, which focuses on a young-at-heart grandmother who would rather spend time with her granddaughter (Watson) than her daughter. The film was directed by Stephen Chbosky, with whom Watson had collaborated on The Perks of Being a Wallflower.[87]","In October 2013, Watson was chosen as the Woman of the Year by British GQ.[88] That same month, she was one of two British actors to land atop a readers' poll of the sexiest movie stars of 2013, beating Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Lawrence for the actresses' title in an online poll of more than 50,000 film fans. Benedict Cumberbatch took the men's vote.[89]","Watson joined Judi Dench, Robert Downey Jr., Mike Leigh, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Mark Ruffalo as recipients of the 2014 Britannia Awards, presented on 30 October in Los Angeles. Watson won for British Artist of the Year and dedicated her award to Millie, her pet hamster who died as Watson filmed Philosopher's Stone.[13] 2015 releases in which Watson starred include two thriller films; first Colonia, co-starring Daniel Brühl and Michael Nyqvist;[90] and second Regression by Alejandro Amenábar, alongside Ethan Hawke and her Harry Potter colleague David Thewlis.[91][92] Both received generally negative reviews.[93][94]","She played Belle in the 2017 live-action Disney adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, opposite Dan Stevens as the Beast.[95] Her reported fee was $3 million upfront with profit participation bringing her total to $15 million.[6] In 2015, she signed up to star opposite Tom Hanks in the film adaptation of David Eggers's novel The Circle as Mae Holland, a young tech worker who takes a job at a powerful Internet corporation only to find herself in a perilous situation concerning privacy, surveillance and freedom.[96] The film, directed by James Ponsoldt, was released on April 28, 2017.","In February 2016, Watson announced she was taking a year-long break from acting. She planned to spend the time on her ""personal development"" and her women's rights work.[97]","In 2005, Watson began her modelling career with a photo shoot for Teen Vogue and was the youngest star to grace its cover.[2] Three years later, the British press reported that Watson was to replace Keira Knightley as the face of the fashion house Chanel, but this was denied by both parties.[98] In June 2009, following several months of rumours, Watson confirmed that she would be partnering with Burberry as the face of their Autumn/Winter 2009 campaign, for which she received an estimated six-figure fee.[10][99] She also appeared in Burberry's 2010 Spring/Summer campaign alongside her brother Alex, musicians George Craig and Matt Gilmour, and model Max Hurd.[100] In February 2011, Watson was awarded the Style Icon award from British Elle by Dame Vivienne Westwood.[101] Watson continued her involvement in fashion advertising when she announced she had been chosen as the face of Lancôme in March 2011.[11]","In September 2009, Watson announced her involvement with People Tree, a Fair Trade fashion brand.[12] Watson worked as a creative advisor for the company to create a spring line of clothing, which was released in February 2010;[12][102] the range featured styles inspired by southern France and London.[102][103] The collection, described by The Times as ""very clever"" despite their ""quiet hope that [she] would become tangled at the first hemp-woven hurdle"",[104] was widely publicised in magazines such as Teen Vogue,[105] Cosmopolitan, and People. Watson, who was not paid for the collaboration,[106] admitted that competition for the range was minimal,[104] but argued that ""Fashion is a great way to empower people and give them skills; rather than give cash to charity you can help people by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in""; adding, ""I think young people like me are becoming increasingly aware of the humanitarian issues surrounding fast fashion and want to make good choices but there aren't many options out there.""[104] Watson continued her involvement with People Tree, resulting in the release of a 2010 Autumn/Winter collection.[107]","Watson was awarded Best British Style at the 2014 British Fashion Awards. The competition included David Beckham, Amal Clooney, Kate Moss and Keira Knightley.[108]","After leaving school, Watson took a gap year[109] to film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows beginning in February 2009,[72] but said she intended to continue her studies[68] and later confirmed that she had chosen Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.[110] In March 2011, after 18 months at the university, Watson announced that she was deferring her course for ""a semester or two"",[111] though she attended Worcester College, Oxford during the 2011–12 academic year as a ""visiting student"".[112]","Watson told Ellen DeGeneres just before graduation that it took five years to finish instead of four because, due to her acting work, she ""ended up taking two full semesters off"".[113] On 25 May 2014, she graduated from Brown University with a bachelor's degree in English literature.[9] In 2013, she became certified to teach yoga and meditation. As part of this certification, she attended a week-long meditation course at a Canadian facility, in which residents are not allowed to speak, in order ""to figure out how to be at home with myself"".[114][115] She told Elle Australia that an uncertain future meant finding ""a way to always feel safe and at home within myself.

In that speech she said she began questioning gender-based assumptions at age eight when she was called ""bossy"" (a trait she has attributed[120] to her being a ""perfectionist"") whilst boys were not, and at 14 when she was ""sexualised by certain elements of the media"".[121] Watson's speech also called feminism ""the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities"" and declared that the perception of ""man-hating"" is something that ""has to stop"".[119] Watson later said she received threats within 12 hours of making the speech, which left her ""raging. ...

Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, ""At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing."" Instead, her original idea was for them to be the ""male equivalent to the Spice Girls"", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style.[193] Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, ""People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [being] dressed in all one colour.

We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean.""[194] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front,[194] ""For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys – posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows.""[194] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, ""One Direction fulfil a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here"".[195]",Headlining,Opening act,"One Direction has received five BRIT Awards—winning their first with ""What Makes You Beautiful"" for Best British Single at the 2012 BRIT Awards,[198] three NME awards,[199] two Kids' Choice Awards,[200] and four MTV Video Music Awards,[72] among other awards.

There was no need to worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show.""[162] Herald Sun's Cameron Adams opined that One Direction have ""strong pop voices"".[163] Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, ""It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere in the midst of all the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain.""[164] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: ""What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert.""[165] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: ""As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out.""[166] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's ""surprisingly accomplished effort"" of Kings of Leon's ""Use Somebody"" proved that One Direction are ""more than capable"" of evolving their sound.[167]","Their third album Midnight Memories (2013) is a pop rock record, a slight departure from the band's original teen pop sound. Liam Payne called Midnight Memories a ""slightly rockier and edgier"" album than their previous material. The album is heavily influenced by 80's rock[168] and folk music and briefly integrates elements of dubstep, notably in ""Little White Lies"". The album's lyrical themes primarily revolve around love, heartbreak and sexual intercourse. Many critics praised its lyrical depth and musical composition, as well as the group's level of involvement in the production process.[169]","Their fourth album Four (2014) was released on 17 November 2014.

Rolling Stone described the record as ""saturated with retro vibes""; its songs ""split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone did last year.""[172]","In 2011, the band performed on the BBC's Children in Need 2011 charity telethon, helping raise over 26 million pounds.[173] In 2012 they extended their involvement with Children in Need as they opened the telecast with a performance of their single ""Live While We're Young"".

They had originally set a goal of raising $500,000 and ended up raising $784,984.

And what could be better than one cute boy, if not five?""[183] One Direction have been described as sparking a resurgence in the interest in boy bands, and as forming part of a new ""British Invasion"" in the United States.[184][185][186][187][188][189] Bill Werde, a representative of Billboard magazine, commented, ""There's a lot of possibility here, there's a lot of upside, that level of talent with those kinds of looks, it's really a perfect storm for a massive, massive successful phenomenon.""[190]","Sonny Takhar, the chief executive officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media. ""Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here – it's the act,"" he said. ""It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before.""[190] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, ""These guys live online, and so do their fans.""[189] Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, ""which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans,"" according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian.[190] One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day.[191] In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is ""the cute one"", Malik is ""the quiet and mysterious one"", Payne is ""the sensible one"", Styles is ""the charming one"" and Tomlinson is ""the funny one"".[192] Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, ""At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing."" Instead, her original idea was for them to be the ""male equivalent to the Spice Girls"", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style.[193] Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, ""People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [being] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean.""[194] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front,[194] ""For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys – posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows.""[194] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, ""One Direction fulfil a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here"".[195]",Headlining,Opening act,"One Direction has received five BRIT Awards—winning their first with ""What Makes You Beautiful"" for Best British Single at the 2012 BRIT Awards,[198] three NME awards,[199] two Kids' Choice Awards,[200] and four MTV Video Music Awards,[72] among other awards.

The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.","NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System,[13] advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program,[14] exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons,[15] and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs.[16] NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite. Since 2011, NASA has been criticized for low cost efficiency, achieving little results in return for high development costs.[17][18][19]",,,"From 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1.[20] In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the ""Sputnik crisis""), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a ""Special Committee on Space Technology"", headed by Guyford Stever.[12] On January 14, 1958, NACA Director Hugh Dryden published ""A National Research Program for Space Technology"" stating:[21]","It is of great urgency and importance to our country both from consideration of our prestige as a nation as well as military necessity that this challenge [Sputnik] be met by an energetic program of research and development for the conquest of space... It is accordingly proposed that the scientific research be the responsibility of a national civilian agency... NACA is capable, by rapid extension and expansion of its effort, of providing leadership in space technology.[21]","While this new federal agency would conduct all non-military space activity, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created in February 1958 to develop space technology for military application.[22]","On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA absorbed the 43-year-old NACA intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of US$100 million, three major research laboratories (Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory) and two small test facilities.[23] A NASA seal was approved by President Eisenhower in 1959.[24] Elements of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and the United States Naval Research Laboratory were incorporated into NASA. A significant contributor to NASA's entry into the Space Race with the Soviet Union was the technology from the German rocket program led by Wernher von Braun, who was now working for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), which in turn incorporated the technology of American scientist Robert Goddard's earlier works.[25] Earlier research efforts within the US Air Force[23] and many of ARPA's early space programs were also transferred to NASA.[26] In December 1958, NASA gained control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a contractor facility operated by the California Institute of Technology.[23]","The agency's leader, NASA's administrator, is nominated by the President of the United States subject to approval of the US Senate, and reports to him or her and serves as senior space science advisor. Though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan, the appointee usually is associated with the President's political party (Democratic or Republican), and a new administrator is usually chosen when the Presidency changes parties. The only exceptions to this have been: James C. Fletcher, appointed by Republican Richard Nixon but stayed through May 1977 into the term of Democrat Jimmy Carter; Daniel Goldin, appointed by Republican George H. W. Bush and stayed through the administration of Democrat Bill Clinton; and Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr., associate administrator under Democrat Barack Obama kept on as acting administrator by Republican Donald Trump.[6] Though the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.[27]",The first administrator was Dr. T. Keith Glennan appointed by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower. During his term he brought together the disparate projects in American space development research.[28],"The third administrator, James E. Webb (1961–1968), appointed by President John F. Kennedy, was a Democrat who first publicly served under President Harry S. Truman. In order to implement the Apollo program to achieve Kennedy's Moon landing goal by the end of the 1960s, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President Lyndon Johnson kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and Republican President Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.",James Fletcher was responsible for early planning of the Space Shuttle program during his first term as administrator under President Nixon. He was appointed for a second term as administrator from May 1986 through April 1989 by President Ronald Reagan to help the agency recover from the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.,"Former astronaut Charles Bolden served as NASA's twelfth administrator from July 2009 to January 20, 2017.[29] Administrator Bolden is one of three former astronauts who became NASA administrators, along with Richard H. Truly (served 1989–1992) and Frederick D. Gregory (acting, 2005).","The agency's administration is located at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC and provides overall guidance and direction.[30] Except under exceptional circumstances, NASA civil service employees are required to be citizens of the United States.[31]","In response to the Apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In the aftermath of the Shuttle Columbia accident, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress.[32] By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).[33]","NASA has conducted many manned and unmanned spaceflight programs throughout its history. Unmanned programs launched the first American artificial satellites into Earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes, and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system, starting with Venus and Mars, and including ""grand tours"" of the outer planets. Manned programs sent the first Americans into low Earth orbit (LEO), won the Space Race with the Soviet Union by landing twelve men on the Moon from 1969 to 1972 in the Apollo program, developed a semi-reusable LEO Space Shuttle, and developed LEO space station capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-Soviet Russia. Some missions include both manned and unmanned aspects, such as the Galileo probe, which was deployed by astronauts in Earth orbit before being sent unmanned to Jupiter.","The experimental rocket-powered aircraft programs started by NACA were extended by NASA as support for manned spaceflight. This was followed by a one-man space capsule program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the Soviet Union, in 1961 President John F. Kennedy proposed the ambitious goal ""of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth."" This goal was met in 1969 by the Apollo program, and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a manned mission to Mars. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet Russia. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets, and thirteen X-15 rocket flights above the USAF definition of spaceflight altitude, 260,000 feet (80 km).[34]","The X-15 was an NACA experimental rocket-powered hypersonic research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy. The design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized control systems.[35] Requests for proposal were issued on December 30, 1954, for the airframe, and February 4, 1955, for the rocket engine. The airframe contract was awarded to North American Aviation in November 1955, and the XLR30 engine contract was awarded to Reaction Motors in 1956, and three planes were built. The X-15 was drop-launched from the wing of one of two NASA Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses, NB52A tail number 52-003, and NB52B, tail number 52-008 (known as the Balls 8). Release took place at an altitude of about 45,000 feet (14 km) and a speed of about 500 miles per hour (805 km/h).","Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force, Navy, and NACA (later NASA). A total of 199 flights were made between 1959 and 1968, resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a manned powered aircraft (current as of 2014[update]), and a maximum speed of Mach 6.72, 4,519 miles per hour (7,273 km/h).[36] The altitude record for X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96 km).[37] Eight of the pilots were awarded Air Force astronaut wings for flying above 260,000 feet (80 km), and two flights by Joseph A. Walker exceeded 100 kilometers (330,000 ft), qualifying as spaceflight according to the International Aeronautical Federation. The X-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the later manned spaceflight programs, including reaction control system jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft, space suits, and horizon definition for navigation.[37] The reentry and landing data collected were valuable to NASA for designing the Space Shuttle.[35]","Shortly after the Space Race began, an early objective was to get a person into Earth orbit as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored. The US Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program considered many manned spacecraft designs, ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic space capsules.[38] By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule.[39]","When NASA was created that same year, the Air Force program was transferred to it and renamed Project Mercury. The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard Freedom 7, launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight.[40] John Glenn became the first American to be launched into orbit by an Atlas launch vehicle on February 20, 1962, aboard Friendship 7.[41] Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit flight Faith 7, May 15–16, 1963.[42]","The Soviet Union (USSR) competed with its own single-pilot spacecraft, Vostok. They sent the first man in space, by launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into a single Earth orbit aboard Vostok 1 in April 1961, one month before Shepard's flight.[43] In August 1962, they achieved an almost four-day record flight with Andriyan Nikolayev aboard Vostok 3, and also conducted a concurrent Vostok 4 mission carrying Pavel Popovich.","Based on studies to grow the Mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965.[44] Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.[45][46]","Under the direction of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the USSR competed with Gemini by converting their Vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man Voskhod. They succeeded in launching two manned flights before Gemini's first flight, achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1963 and the first EVA in 1964. After this, the program was canceled, and Gemini caught up while spacecraft designer Sergei Korolev developed the Soyuz spacecraft, their answer to Apollo.","The U.S public's perception of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man in space) motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo program.[47]","Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever. It cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars[48] or an estimated $208 billion in present-day US dollars.[49] (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $26.6 billion, accounting for inflation.)[49][50] It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects.[51] The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.","The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968.[52] Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the Moon.[53] On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced[54][55] and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.[56]","The first person to stand on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, who was followed by Buzz Aldrin, while Michael Collins orbited above. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon. These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms (842 lb) of lunar samples. Topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismology, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar wind.[57] The Moon landing marked the end of the space race; and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the Moon.[58]","Apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body.[59] Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.","Skylab was the United States' first and only independently built space station.[60] Conceived in 1965 as a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent Saturn IB upper stage, the 169,950 lb (77,088 kg) station was constructed on Earth and launched on May 14, 1973, atop the first two stages of a Saturn V, into a 235-nautical-mile (435 km) orbit inclined at 50° to the equator. Damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel, it was repaired to functionality by its first crew. It was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974.[60] It included a laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity, and a solar observatory.[60] NASA planned to have a Space Shuttle dock with it, and elevate Skylab to a higher safe altitude, but the Shuttle was not ready for flight before Skylab's re-entry on July 11, 1979.[61]","To save cost, NASA used one of the Saturn V rockets originally earmarked for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the Skylab. Apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the station. Three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28, 59, and 84 days. Skylab's habitable volume was 11,290 cubic feet (320 m3), which was 30.7 times bigger than that of the Apollo Command Module.[61]","On May 24, 1972, US President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission, and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other.[62] This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus Apollo Command/Service Module with a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975. This was the last US manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the Space Shuttle in April 1981.[63]","The mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments, and provided useful engineering experience for future joint US–Russian space flights, such as the Shuttle–Mir Program[64] and the International Space Station.","The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, Columbia, did so on April 12, 1981,[65] the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight.[66]","Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 km (115–400 miles)[67] and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg (54,000 lb).[68] Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.[67]","On 20 missions (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock.[69] Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.[70]","In 1995, Russian-American interaction resumed with the Shuttle–Mir missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, this time a full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.","The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003.[71] While the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss.[71] NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.[72]","The International Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's Space Station Freedom project with the Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module.[73] NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).[74][75] The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles.[73] It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016.[76][77][needs update] The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements[78] which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya),[79][80] with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.[78]","Long duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS.[81] The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members.[82] Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational.[83] The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past 7008520653257000000♠16 years and 182 days, having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.[84][85]","The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2017, is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.[86] The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz.[87] The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.[88]","The ISS program is expected to continue until at least 2020, and may be extended beyond 2028.[89]","The development of the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) vehicles began in 2006 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the ISS.[90] The development of these vehicles was under a fixed price milestone-based program, meaning that each company that received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value attached to them that they didn't receive until after they had successful completed the milestone.[91] Private companies were also required to have some ""skin in the game"" which refers raising an unspecified amount of private investment for their proposal.[92]","On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Services contracts to SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corporation.[93] SpaceX uses its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft.[94] Orbital Sciences uses its Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft. The first Dragon resupply mission occurred in May 2012.[95] The first Cygnus resupply mission occurred in September 2013.[96] The CRS program now provides for all America's ISS cargo needs; with the exception of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the European ATV and the Japanese HTV.[97]","The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth.[98] It is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by Bigelow Aerospace.[99] Like COTS, CCDev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.[91]","In 2010, NASA announced the winners of the first phase of the program, a total of $50 million was divided among five American companies to foster research and development into human spaceflight concepts and technologies in the private sector. In 2011, the winners of the second phase of the program were announced, $270 million was divided among four companies.[100] In 2012, the winners of the third phase of the program were announced, NASA provided $1.1 billion divided among three companies to further develop their crew transportation systems.[101] In 2014, the winners of the final round were announced.[102] SpaceX's Dragon V2 (planned to be launched on a Falcon 9 v1.1) received a contract valued up to $2.6 billion and Boeing's CST-100 (to be launched on an Atlas V) received a contract valued up to $4.2 billion.[103] NASA expects these vehicles to begin transporting humans to the ISS in 2017.[103]",Dragon V2,Computer rendering of CST-100 in orbit,"For missions beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA has been directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies.[104] During a speech at the Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V.[105] In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s.[105] The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010.[106] The act officially canceled the Constellation program.[106]","The Authorization Act required a newly designed HLV be chosen within 90 days of its passing; the launch vehicle was given the name ""Space Launch System"". The new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft.[107] The Orion spacecraft, which was being developed as part of the Constellation program, was chosen to fulfill this role.[108] The Space Launch System is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low Earth orbit.[109] The SLS is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions. The initial capability of SLS is required to be able to lift 70 mt into LEO. It is then planned to be upgraded to 105 mt and then eventually to 130 mt.[108][110]","Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1), an unmanned test flight of Orion's crew module, was launched on December 5, 2014, atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket.[110] Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) is the unmanned initial launch of SLS that would also send Orion on a circumlunar trajectory, which is planned for 2017.[110] The first manned flight of Orion and SLS, Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2) is to launch between 2019 and 2021; it is a 10- to 14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into Lunar orbit.[110] As of March 2012, the destination for EM-3 and the intermediate focus for this new program is still in-flux.[111]","On June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA announced plans to build a series of new X-planes over the next 10 years.[112] One of the planes will reportedly be a supersonic vehicle that burns low-carbon biofuels and generates quiet sonic booms.[112]",NASA plans to build full scale deep space habitats as part of its Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program.[113],"More than 1,000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the solar system.[114] Besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched by NASA.[115] The missions have been launched directly from Earth or from orbiting space shuttles, which could either deploy the satellite itself, or with a rocket stage to take it farther.","The first US unmanned satellite was Explorer 1, which started as an ABMA/JPL project during the early part of the Space Race. It was launched in January 1958, two months after Sputnik. At the creation of NASA the Explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this day. Its missions have been focusing on the Earth and the Sun, measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind, among other aspects.[116] A more recent Earth mission, not related to the Explorer program, was the Hubble Space Telescope, which as mentioned above was brought into orbit in 1990.[117]","The inner Solar System has been made the goal of at least four unmanned programs. The first was Mariner in the 1960s and '70s, which made multiple visits to Venus and Mars and one to Mercury. Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (Mariner 2), to take the first pictures from another planet (Mariner 4), the first planetary orbiter (Mariner 9), and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver (Mariner 10). This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.[118]",The first successful landing on Mars was made by Viking 1 in 1976. Twenty years later a rover was landed on Mars by Mars Pathfinder.[119],"Outside Mars, Jupiter was first visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973. More than 20 years later Galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet.[120] Pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit Saturn in 1979, with Voyager 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.[121]","Pioneers 10 and 11 and both Voyager probes carry messages from the Earth to extraterrestrial life.[122][123] Communication can be difficult with deep space travel. For instance, it took about three hours for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft when it was more than halfway to Pluto.[124] Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.[125]","On November 26, 2011, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission was successfully launched for Mars. Curiosity successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars.[126][127][128]","NASA's ongoing investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars (Mars 2020 and InSight) and Saturn and studies of the Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are Juno for Jupiter, Cassini for Saturn, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for the asteroid belt.

The word Real is Spanish for Royal and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history.","The club was estimated to be worth €3.24 billion ($3.65 billion) in 2015, and in the 2014–15 season it was the world's highest-earning football club, with an annual revenue of €577 million.[5][6][7] The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world.[8] Real Madrid is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and the El Derbi madrileño with Atlético Madrid.","Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s, winning five consecutive European Cups and reaching the final seven times. This success was replicated in the league, where the club won five times in the space of seven years. This team, which consisted of players such as Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[9][10][11]","In domestic football, the club has won a record 32 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey, nine Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.[12] In international football, the club has won a record 11 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a joint record three Intercontinental Cups, two UEFA Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, and two FIFA Club World Cups.","Real Madrid was recognised as the FIFA Club of the 20th Century on 23 December 2000, and named Best European Club of the 20th Century by the IFFHS on 11 May 2010. The club received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004. The club is ranked first in the latest IFFHS Club World Ranking, setting a new ranking-points record.[13] The club also leads the current UEFA club rankings.[14]",,,"Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded Football Club Sky in 1897, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. It split into two clubs in 1900: New Foot-Ball de Madrid and Madrid Football Club.[15] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[3] Three years after its foundation, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between grounds the team moved to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[16] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[17]","In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[18] Real Madrid won its first League title in the 1931–32 season. Real won the League again the following year, becoming the first team to have won the championship twice.[19]","On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and went back to being named Madrid Football Club. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943 Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of a semi-final[20] of the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa del Rey having been renamed in honour of General Franco. It has been suggested that Barcelona players were intimidated by police,[21] including by the director of state security who ""allegedly told the team that some of them were only playing because of the regime's generosity in permitting them to remain in the country.""[22] The Barcelona chairman, Enric Piñeyro, was assaulted by Madrid fans.[23] However, none of these allegations have been proven and FIFA and UEFA still consider the result as legitimate. According to Spanish journalist and writer, Juan Carlos Pasamontes, Barcelona player Josep Valle denied that the Spanish security forces came before the match.[24] Instead, at the end of the first half, Barcelona coach Juan José Nogués and all of his players were angry with the hard-style of play Real Madrid was using and with the aggressiveness of the home crowd.[24] When they refused to take the field, the Superior Chief of Police of Madrid appeared, identified himself, and ordered the team to take the field.[24]","Santiago Bernabéu Yeste became president of Real Madrid in 1945.[25] Under his presidency, the club, its stadium Santiago Bernabéu and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva were rebuilt after the Spanish Civil War damages. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or ""cantera,"" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[26]","In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by the French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe Gabriel Hanot, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created an exhibition tournament of invited teams from around Europe that would eventually become what today is known as the UEFA Champions League.[27] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[26] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[28]","The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966 defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[29] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name ""Ye-yé"" came from the ""Yeah, yeah, yeah"" chorus in The Beatles' song ""She Loves You"" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[30] The Ye-yé generation was also European Cup runner-up in 1962 and 1964.[29] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won five league championships and three Spanish Cups.[31] The club played its first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final in 1971 and lost to English side Chelsea 2–1.[32] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[33] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in the memory of its former president.","By the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the Liga title until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[34] Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (""Vulture's Cohort""), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manuel Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[34] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups.[34] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.","In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid was proclaimed league champion and players like Roberto Carlos, Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker and Clarence Seedorf arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro, Iván Zamorano, and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Predrag Mijatović.[35]","In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[36] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[37] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[38] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons.[39]","The few days after the capturing of the 2003 Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[40] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[41] ""That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,"" stated Zidane.[42] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[42]","The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million) and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[43] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[44] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[45] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after losing the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinal, 6–1 to Real Zaragoza.[46] Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[47]","Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[48] On 9 June 2007, Real played against Zaragoza at La Romareda. Zaragoza led Real 2–1 near the end of the match while Barcelona were also winning against Espanyol 2–1. A late Ruud van Nistelrooy equalizer followed by a last-minute Raúl Tamudo goal sprang Real Madrid's title hopes back into their favour.","The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona; however, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[49] The first goal came from José Antonio Reyes, who scored after a good work from Gonzalo Higuaín. An own goal followed by another goal from Reyes allowed Real to begin celebrating the title.[49] Thousands of Real Madrid fans began going to Plaza de Cibeles to celebrate the title.[49]","On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency.[50] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking sum of £56 million,[51] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[52]","José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[53][54] In April 2011, a strange occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was for the Liga campaign on 17 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the Copa del Rey final (which ended 1–0 to Madrid) and the controversial two-legged Champions League semifinal on 27 April and 2 May (3–1 loss on aggregate) to Barcelona.[55]","In the 2011–12 La Liga season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in the league's history, also finishing the season with numerous club-level records set, including 100 points reached in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89 and 16 away wins, with 32 wins overall.[56] In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo become the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 games. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60), and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[57][58]","Real Madrid began the 2012–13 season winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals, but finished as second in the league competition. A major transfer of the season was signing from Tottenham Hotspur of Luka Modrić for a fee in the region of £33 million. In the Champions League, they were drawn in the ""group of death"" alongside Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City and Ajax, finishing second with three points behind Dortmund. In the round of 16, they defeated Manchester United, Galatasaray in the quarter-finals, and reached their third-straight semi-final finish in the Champions League, when they were again stopped by Dortmund. After a disappointing extra time loss to Atlético Madrid in the 2013 Copa del Rey Final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by ""mutual agreement.""[59][60]","On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal.[61] A day later, he was introduced at his first press conference for Madrid where it was announced that both Zinedine Zidane and Paul Clement will be his assistants.[62] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer from Tottenham of Gareth Bale was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly the new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[63] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid won the Copa del Rey, with Bale scoring the winner in the final against Barcelona.[64] On 24 May, Real Madrid defeated city rivals Atlético Madrid in the 2014 Champions League Final, winning their first European title since 2002,[65] and becoming the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as ""La Décima"".[66]","""In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world.""","After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[69] The club won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, with two goals by Cristiano Ronaldo, the club's 79th official trophy.[70] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key in the previous season's successes—Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United, the latter for an English record fee of €75 million. This decision from the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, ""If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,"" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, ""We must start again from zero.""[71][72]","After a slow start to the 2014–15 La Liga season, which included defeats to Atlético Madrid and Real Sociedad, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[73] In December 2014, the club extended their winning streak to 22 games with a 2–0 win over San Lorenzo in the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup final, thus ending the calendar year with four trophies.[74] Their 22-game winning streak ended in their opening game of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[75] The club failed to retain the Champions League (losing 3–2 on aggregate against Juventus in the semi-finals), the Copa del Rey (4–2 aggregate loss to Atlético), and failed to land the league title (finishing two points and a place behind champions Barcelona), shortcomings that all preceded Ancelotti's sacking on 25 May 2015.[76]","On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager, signing a three-year contract.[77] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla in the 11th matchday. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Real played Cádiz in the Copa del Rey Round of 32, winning away 1–3 in the first leg. However, they fielded an ineligible player in Denis Cheryshev as he was suspended for that match, resulting in the second leg being cancelled and Real being disqualified. Meanwhile, Real topped their UEFA Champions League group with 16 points. He was sacked on 4 January 2016, following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top sides.[78] At the time of sacking, Real were third in La Liga, four points behind leaders Atlético Madrid and two points behind arch-rivals Barcelona (with a game in hand).[79]","On 4 January 2016, Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[80] Zidane previously worked as assistant to Benítez's predecessor Carlo Ancelotti and, since 2014, had occupied the helm of reserve team Real Madrid Castilla.[80] Zidane's coaching debut for Madrid was marked by a 5–0 home victory over Deportivo in La Liga on 9 January 2016, with Gareth Bale scoring a hat-trick.[81] On 28 May, Real Madrid won their 11th Champions League title, extending their record for most successes in the competition, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring the decisive penalty in a shootout win over Atlético Madrid in the final.[82] On 10 December 2016, Madrid won 3–2 against Deportivo de La Coruña, which was their 35th straight match without a loss, which set a new record.[83] On 18 December 2016, Madrid defeated Japanese club Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick.[84]",1902,1908,1920,1931,1941,"The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, ""MCF"" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[85] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title ""Real Madrid,"" meaning ""Royal.""[86] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[85]","With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all the royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[19] In 1941, two years after the end of the Civil War, the crest's ""Real Corona"", or ""Royal Crown"", was restored while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[25] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club was again called Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[85] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[85]","Real Madrid's traditional home colours are all white, although before its foundation, in the club's first game against themselves, they adopted a blue and a red oblique stripe on the shirt to differentiate the two teams (the club crest design has a purple stripe which is not associated to this. It was incorporated the year they lost the royal crown, as it the traditional region of Castile colour); but unlike today, black socks were worn. Lastly, the black socks will be replaced by dark blue ones.[18][87] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[88] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[25] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[89]","Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[90][91] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[92][93] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens Mobile and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[94] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[95][96] It is currently Fly Emirates.","After moving between grounds, the team moved to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home ground for 11 years.[16] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid moved its home matches to Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[98] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[18] After some successes, the 1943 elected president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Estadio Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and was inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[25][99] This was the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium as it is known today, although it did not acquire the present name until 1955.[26] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Real Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses and won by Los Blancos, 3–1, the first goal being scored by Sabino Barinaga.[25]","The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[100] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing places went away in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which forbids standing at matches in the UEFA competition), countered to some extent by expansions.[100] The last change was an increase of about five thousand to a capacity of 85,454, effected in 2011. A plan to add a retractable roof has been announced.[99] Real Madrid has the fourth-highest of the average attendances of European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[101][102][103][104]","The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, the 1957, 1969 and 1980 European Cup finals and the 2010 Champions League Final.[105] The stadium has its own Madrid Metro station along the 10 line called Santiago Bernabéu.[106] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu has been upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[107]","On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium was inaugurated in the City of Madrid, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Stade Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid won the match 6–1 with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's new training facilities located outside Madrid in Valdebebas. The stadium holds 5,000 people and is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground. It is named after former Real legend Alfredo Di Stéfano.[108]","Raúl holds the record for most Real Madrid appearances, having played 741 first-team matches from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis, Jr., having played 710 times.[109] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 166* caps (162 while at the club), he is also Real's most capped international player while with 127 caps (47 while at the club).","Cristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 392 goals.[110][111] Five other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–64), Santillana (1971–88), Ferenc Puskás (1958–66), Hugo Sánchez (1985–92) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 279 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, which now is held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 98 goals. The fastest goal in the history of the club (12 seconds) was scored by the Brazilian Ronaldo on 3 December 2003 during a league match against Atlético Madrid.[112]","Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 83,329, which was for a football cup competition, the Copa del Rey, in 2006. The current legal capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,354.[113] The club's average attendance in 2007–08 season was 76,234, the highest in European Leagues.[114] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (32 as of 2012–13) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[115]","The club also hold the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League eleven times[116] and for the most semi-final appearances (27). As of April 2016, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 98 goals in total, 82 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[117] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide.[118] The same season the team tied the win-streak for games in the Champions League, with ten.[119] As of April 2017, holds the Spanish record of consecutive matches scoring in a row with 53, second best in European history.[120]","In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football by agreeing to pay Manchester United €96 million (US$131.5 million, £80 million) for the services of Cristiano Ronaldo.[121][122] The fee of €76 million (over $100 million, £45.8 million) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan. The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly the new world record signing, with the transfer price expected at around €100 million.[63] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[123] The club's sale record came on 26 August 2014, when Manchester United signed Ángel Di María for €75 million.[124]","During most home matches the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[125] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[126][127]","Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[128][129] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[130][131] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[132]","There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as ""The Classic"" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions, the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain, Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[133] Over the years, the record from Real Madrid and Barcelona is 81 victories for Madrid, 76 victories for Barcelona, and 39 draws.[134]","During the dictatorships of Primo de Rivera and especially of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned.[135][136] Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barcelona became ""More than a club"" (""Més que un club"") for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barcelona. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence.[137]","On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond– Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom Real Madrid's stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War.[138][139] During the war, however, members of both clubs, such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra, suffered at the hands of Francoists.","During the 1950s, the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano, who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success.[140] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice in a controversial knock-out round of the European Cup, with Madrid receiving unfavourable treatment from the referee.[141][142] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the ""Match of The Century"" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people.[143]","The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of Madrid FC. Tensions escalated further after Atlético were merged with the football team of the Spanish airforce (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), and in the 1940s, Atlético was perceived as the preferred team of Franco's regime before he revelled in Real's European success in the 1950s.[144][145] Furthermore, Real supporters initially came from the middle and upper classes while the Atlético supporters were drawn from the working class. Today, however, these distinctions are largely blurred. They met for the first time on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first League Championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[18]","The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-final. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Bernabéu while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[146]","Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning Liga titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favorable.[147] A high point coming in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 0–4 victory at Atlético at the Vicente Calderón Stadium. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came with the Copa del Rey win in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from same city. Real Madrid triumphed with 4–1 in extra time.[148] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[149] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético met again for the Champions League title in Milan which resulted in a win for Real Madrid via Penalty Shootout.[150]","Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, Real winning eleven times and Bayern winning five times. Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 23 matches. Real's biggest loss at home in the Champions League came at the hands of Bayern on 29 February 2000, 2–4.[151] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the ""Bestia negra"" (""Black Beast""). The two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which resulted in 3–3 on aggregate, forcing extra time and penalties. Bayern won 3–1 on penalties to reach their first-ever home Champions League final. They then again met in 2013–14 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, a rematch of the 2012 semi-final, with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate.[152]","It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[153] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[39] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[154]","The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[155] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[42]","By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in football, with a value of €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[156] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[157] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[158] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open its own dedicated theme park by 2013.[159]","A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid ""is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.""[160] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second after Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[161][162] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[163]","Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that Real Madrid is owned by its supporters who elect the club president. The club president cannot invest his own money into the club[164] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through merchandise sales, television rights and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[165] The members of Real Madrid, called socios, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[166] As of 2010, the club has 60,000 socios.[167] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[168][169]","During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, which was the highest in top-flight football.[168] The club has the highest number of shirt sales a season, around 1.5 million.[168] For the 2010–11 season its wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona.[170] However, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[7]","Real Madrid was the featured club in the second edition of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted, and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Fredrik Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[171]","Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid C.F. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for Real Madrid. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas, and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase.","The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages.

Conan_O'Brien,"Conan Christopher O'Brien (born April 18, 1963) is an American television host, comedian, and television producer. He is best known for hosting several late-night talk shows; since 2010 he has hosted Conan on the cable channel TBS. O'Brien was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and was raised in an Irish Catholic family. He served as president of The Harvard Lampoon while attending Harvard University, and was a writer for the sketch comedy series Not Necessarily the News.","After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of Saturday Night Live. O'Brien was a writer and producer for The Simpsons for two seasons until he was commissioned by NBC to take over David Letterman's position as host of Late Night in 1993. A virtual unknown to the public, O'Brien's initial Late Night tenure received unfavorable reviews and remained on a multiweek renewal cycle during its early years. The show generally improved over time and was highly regarded by the time of his departure in 2009. Afterwards, O'Brien relocated from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of The Tonight Show for seven months until network politics prompted a host change in 2010.","Known for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized as ""awkward, self-deprecating humor"", O'Brien's late-night programs combine the ""lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (remotes)"".[1] He has hosted Conan since 2010 and has also hosted such events as the Emmy Awards and Christmas in Washington.[2][3] O'Brien has been the subject of a documentary, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop (2011), and has also hosted a 32-city live comedy tour.","With the retirement of David Letterman on May 20, 2015, O'Brien became the longest-working of all current late-night talk show hosts in the United States, at 22 years.[4]",,,"O'Brien was born on April 18, 1963 in Brookline, Massachusetts.[5] His father, Thomas Francis O'Brien, is a physician, epidemiologist, and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.[6][7][8] His mother, Ruth O'Brien (née Reardon), is an attorney and partner at the Boston firm Ropes & Gray.[9] He is the third of six children. O'Brien's family is Irish Catholic; some of his Irish ancestors immigrated before the American Civil War.[8] In a Late Night episode, O'Brien paid a visit to County Kerry, Ireland, where his ancestors originated.","O'Brien attended Brookline High School, where he served as the managing editor of the school newspaper, The Sagamore.[8] In his second year, O'Brien was an intern for Congressman Robert Drinan[10] and in his senior year, he won the National Council of Teachers of English writing contest with his short story, ""To Bury the Living"".[11] After graduating as valedictorian in 1981, he entered Harvard University.[12] At Harvard, O'Brien lived in Holworthy Hall during his first year[13] and Mather House during his three upper-class years. He concentrated in history and literature and graduated magna cum laude[14] in 1985.[15] O'Brien's senior thesis concerned the use of children as symbols in the works of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor.[16][17] During college O'Brien briefly served as the drummer in a band called ""The Bad Clams"", was a writer for the Harvard Lampoon humor magazine,[18] and developed a spoof of the popular video game One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird in which the Boston Celtics play against a classical ballet troupe.[19] During his sophomore and junior years he served as the Lampoon's president.[20] At this time, O'Brien's future boss at NBC, Jeff Zucker, was serving as President of the school's newspaper The Harvard Crimson.[21]","O'Brien moved to Los Angeles after graduation to join the writing staff of HBO's Not Necessarily the News.[22] He was also a writer on the short-lived The Wilton North Report.[22] He spent two years with that show and performed regularly with improvisational groups, including The Groundlings. In January 1988, Saturday Night Live's executive producer, Lorne Michaels, hired O'Brien as a writer. During his three years on Saturday Night Live (SNL), he wrote such recurring sketches as ""Mr. Short-Term memory"" and ""The Girl Watchers""; the latter was first performed by Tom Hanks and Jon Lovitz.[23] O'Brien also co-wrote the sketch ""Nude Beach"" with Robert Smigel, in which the word ""penis"" was said or sung at least 42 times. While on a writers' strike from Saturday Night Live following the 1987–88 season, O'Brien put on an improvisational comedy revue in Chicago with fellow SNL writers Bob Odenkirk and Robert Smigel called Happy Happy Good Show.[24][25] While living in Chicago, O'Brien briefly roomed with Jeff Garlin.[26] In 1989, O'Brien and his fellow SNL writers received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series.","O'Brien, like many SNL writers, occasionally appeared as an extra in sketches; his most notable appearance was as a doorman in a sketch in which Tom Hanks was inducted into the SNL ""Five-Timers Club"" for hosting his fifth episode. O'Brien returned to host the show in 2001 during its 26th season. O'Brien and Robert Smigel wrote the television pilot for Lookwell starring Adam West, which aired on NBC in 1991. The pilot never went to series, but it became a cult hit. It was later screened at The Other Network, a festival of unaired TV pilots produced by Un-Cabaret; it featured an extended interview with O'Brien and was rerun in 2002 on the Trio network.","Things changed for O'Brien in 1991, when in quick succession, an engagement fell through; Lookwell was not picked up; and, burned out, he quit Saturday Night Live.[27] ""I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't come back to work and I just needed to do something else,"" O'Brien recalled. ""I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me.""[28] Mike Reiss and Al Jean, then dual showrunners of The Simpsons, called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was notorious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls ""everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired.""[28] O'Brien was one of the first hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend Lisa Kudrow, O'Brien purchased an apartment in Beverly Hills.[27][29] He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000,[30] O'Brien credited The Simpsons with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his being hired for the show.[31]","I was very nervous when I started. They showed me into this office and told me to start writing down some ideas. They left me alone in that office. I left after five minutes to go get a cup of coffee. I heard a crash. I walked back to the office, and there was a hole in the window and a dead bird on the floor. Literally, in my first ten minutes at The Simpsons, a bird had flown through the glass of my window, hit the far wall, broken its neck, and fallen dead on the floor. George Meyer came in and looked at it, and said, ""Man, this is some kind of weird omen.""","From 1991 to 1993, O'Brien was a writer and producer for The Simpsons. When O'Brien first arrived at the Fox lot, they temporarily gave him writer Jeff Martin's office. O'Brien was nervous and self-conscious, feeling that he would embarrass himself in front of what he regarded as an intimidating collection of writers.[28] O'Brien would pitch characters in their voices as he thought that was the norm until Reiss informed him that no one did such.[32][33] He fit in quickly, commanding control of the room frequently; Josh Weinstein called it a ""ten-hour Conan show, nonstop"".[28] According to John Ortved, one of his fellow writers ventured that if Conan hadn't left to do Late Night, he was a shoo-in to take over as showrunner on The Simpsons.[28]","When not contributing to others' scripts, O'Brien managed to craft what are regarded as some of the series' most memorable and finest episodes: ""Marge vs. the Monorail"" and ""Homer Goes to College"".[28][34] Generally, critics, fans and even those who worked on the show agree that its sensibilities changed following ""Marge vs. the Monorail.""[35] The show was initially a highly realistic family sitcom; after O'Brien's debut, the show took a rapid shift in the direction of the surreal.[35] Along with those episodes, he has sole writing credits on ""New Kid on the Block"" and ""Treehouse of Horror IV"", on which he wrote the episode wraparounds. Wallace Wolodarsky described a ""room character"" Conan put on for the writers: ""Conan used to do this thing called the Nervous Writer that involved him opening a can of Diet Coke and then nervously pitching a joke. He would spray Diet Coke all over himself, and that was always a source of endless amusement among us.""[32] Occasionally, fellow writers from the show would stop by O'Brien's Beverly Hills apartment.[29]","Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was preparing to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels to search for a new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce.[35] He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers.[36] Wolodarksky recalled the experience: ""Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening.""[36] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993.[1] As the writers headed to the voice record for ""Homer Goes to College"", O'Brien received a phone call from Polone informing him of the decision. ""He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet,"" recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. ""I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'""[37]","Fox, however, would not let O'Brien out of his contract. Eventually, NBC and O'Brien would split the cost to get him out of the contract.[37][38][39] After O'Brien's departure, the writers at The Simpsons would watch videotaped episodes of Late Night at lunch the day following their midnight broadcast and analyze them.[37] During his time at The Simpsons, O'Brien also had a side project working with Smigel on the script for a musical film based on the ""Hans and Franz"" sketch from Saturday Night Live, but the film was never produced.[40][41]","Late Night with Conan O'Brien, originating from Studio 6A at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, premiered September 13, 1993 to unfavorable reviews from contemporary critics. This reception was not completely unsurprising; O'Brien wrote a self-deprecating New York Times piece titled ""O'Brien Flops!"" on the day of the show's premiere.[42] Critics attacked O'Brien: Tom Shales of The Washington Post suggested that ""the host resume his previous identity, Conan O'Blivion.""[1][43] Generally, critics viewed O'Brien as nervous and fidgety on-camera, and that he was ""too smart, too East Coast, too sophisticated, too young and even too tall to be successful.""[1] The show was constantly at risk for cancellation; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who followed O'Brien with Later at 1:30 am.[1] Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts.[44][45] In one installment after a short stretch of reruns, sidekick Andy Richter described his vacation activities as follows: ""I sat back and reminded myself what it's like to be unemployed."" The in-joke referenced the rumors floating in the trades that NBC was near canceling the program.[46]","Things would improve slowly. Banter between O'Brien and Richter improved, and sketches grew in popularity (""If They Mated"", ""Desk Drive"", ""In the Year 2000"").[45] A reliable staple involved a TV screen, lowered behind O'Brien's desk and displaying a still photo of news figure. The lips and voice of these characters – frequently a party-crazed hillbilly interpretation of Bill Clinton – were supplied by writing partner Robert Smigel.[45] A turning point was David Letterman's February 1994 appearance. ""It was a morale boost,"" said O'Brien. ""I'm thinking, If the guy who created the 12:30 thing comes on and says we're smart and funny, let's go.""[47] The show went through a temporary wobble in January 1995 when Robert Smigel, feeling burned out, quit as head writer.[27] The show's quality improved slowly over time, and most credit O'Brien's growing comedic performance.[citation needed] Within a year, a comedic formula began to arise: the show would combine the lewd and wacky with a more elegant, narrative-driven remotes.[1] Regular characters would typically include a ""Masturbating Bear"" and a famous remote found Conan visit a historic, Civil War-era baseball league.[1] That piece was one of O'Brien's personal favorites, later remarking, ""When I leave this earth, at the funeral, just show this, because this pretty much says who I'm all about.""[48]","O'Brien's audience, largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily and the show began to best competitors in the ratings, which it would continue to do for 15 seasons.[1] In the early days of the Internet, fans launched unofficial websites, compiling precise summaries of each episode.[49] Even Tom Shales was a convert: he called the show ""one of the most amazing transformations in television history.""[45] Beginning in 1996, O'Brien and the Late Night writing team were nominated annually for the Emmy Award for Best Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series, winning the award for the first and only time in 2007. In 1997, 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004, he and the Late Night writing staff won the Writers Guild Award for Best Writing in a Comedy/Variety Series. In 2001, he formed his own television production company, Conaco, which subsequently shared in the production credits for Late Night.[8]","As of October 2005[update], Late Night with Conan O'Brien had for eleven years consistently attracted an audience averaging about 2.5 million viewers.[44] The apotheosis of the Late Night remotes centered on the realization in 2006 that O'Brien bore a striking resemblance to the then female president of Finland, Tarja Halonen. ""We took the show to Helsinki for five days,"" O'Brien recalled, ""where we were embraced like a national treasure.""[1][50]","On February 20, 2009, NBC aired the last episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien. The show consisted of a compilation of previous Late Night clips and included a surprise appearance by former sidekick Andy Richter. Will Ferrell, John Mayer, and the White Stripes also appeared. O'Brien ended the episode by destroying the set with an axe, handing out the pieces of the set to the audience,[51][52] and thanking a list of people who helped him get to that point in his career. Among those thanked were Lorne Michaels, David Letterman, Jay Leno, and O'Brien's wife and children.","During the writers' strike in 2008, O'Brien staged a mock feud with Comedy Central's Jon Stewart (of The Daily Show) and Stephen Colbert (of The Colbert Report) over a dispute about which of the three were responsible for giving a ""bump"" to Mike Huckabee's campaign to become the Republican presidential nominee. This feud crossed over all three shows during the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.[53]","In 2004, O'Brien negotiated a new contract with NBC. As part of the deal, O'Brien would take over The Tonight Show from Jay Leno in 2009.[8] O'Brien was a guest on Jay Leno's final episode of The Tonight Show. On June 1, 2009, Will Ferrell became Conan's first Tonight Show guest on the couch and Pearl Jam appeared as his first musical guest.[54]","During the taping of the Friday, September 25, 2009, episode of The Tonight Show, O'Brien suffered from a mild concussion after he slipped and hit his head while running a race as part of a comedy sketch with guest Teri Hatcher. He was examined at a hospital and released the same day. A rerun was aired that night, but O'Brien returned to work the following Monday and poked fun at the incident.[55][56]","On Thursday, January 7, 2010, NBC executive Jeff Zucker met with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien to discuss how to get Leno out of prime time, where his ratings were lackluster, and back into late night, where O'Brien's ratings had collapsed before Leno's prime time series began. A proposal was made that would see O'Brien remain as host of The Tonight Show, which would be moved to 12:05 am with Leno hosting a 30-minute show at 11:35 pm[57] On January 10, NBC Universal Television Entertainment chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that The Jay Leno Show would indeed end at the start of the Winter Olympics on February 12, 2010, and be moved to 11:35 pm following the Olympics coverage.[58] Sources familiar with the situation told the New York Post that O'Brien was unhappy with NBC's plan.[59]","Every comedian, every comedian dreams of hosting The Tonight Show and—for seven months—I got to do it. I did it my way, with people I love, and I do not regret a second [of it].... All I ask is one thing, and I'm asking this particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical. I hate cynicism; for the record it's my least favorite quality. It doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.","On January 12, O'Brien released this statement: ""I sincerely believe that delaying The Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn’t The Tonight Show.""[61][62] On January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan had reached a deal with NBC that would see him exit The Tonight Show the next day. The deal also granted him $45 million, of which $12 million was designated for distribution to his staff, who had moved with Conan to Los Angeles from New York when he left Late Night.","The final Tonight Show with Conan aired January 22, 2010, and featured guests Tom Hanks, Steve Carell (who did an exit interview and shredded Conan's ID badge), Neil Young (singing ""Long May You Run""), and Will Ferrell. For Ferrell's appearance, Conan played guitar with the band and Ferrell sang ""Free Bird"" while reprising his SNL cowbell. Ferrell's wife, Viveca Paulin, together with Ben Harper, Beck, and ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons, also joined the band for this final performance.[63]","Jay Leno returned to The Tonight Show following NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Under the $45 million deal with NBC, Conan was allowed to start working for another network as soon as September 2010.[64][65][66] Conan's rumored next networks ranged anywhere from Fox[67] to Comedy Central.[68][69]","On February 8, 2010, it was reported that O'Brien was attempting to sell his Central Park West penthouse in New York with an asking price of $35 million.[70] He had purchased the apartment in 2007 for $10 million.[70] Two years earlier, O'Brien had purchased a home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles for over $10.5 million.[71] Some industry insiders have speculated that O'Brien had chosen to stay on the west coast in order to facilitate a return to late night television[70] and because he did not want to put his children through another move.[72]","On February 24, 2010, O'Brien attracted media attention for starting a Twitter account.[73][74] His tweets, although primarily jokes, amounted to his first public statements since leaving The Tonight Show one month earlier.[75] After about one hour, O'Brien's subscriber list had rocketed to over 30,000 members, and approximately 30 minutes later he was on the brink of passing 50,000 followers, already 20,000 more than the verified @jayleno account.[76][77][78] After 24 hours, O'Brien had well over 300,000 followers.[75] In late May 2010, he surpassed the one million mark for number of Twitter followers,[79] and as of March 2015[update] he has over fifteen million followers.[80]","O'Brien has been named to the 2010 Time 100, a list compiled by TIME of the 100 most influential people in the world as voted on by readers.[81] After being prohibited from making television appearances of any kind until May, O'Brien spoke about the Tonight Show conflict on the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes on May 2, 2010.[82] During the interview with Steve Kroft, O'Brien said the situation felt ""like a marriage breaking up suddenly, violently, quickly. And I was just trying to figure out what happened."" He also said he ""absolutely"" expected NBC to give him more of a chance and that, if in Jay Leno's position, he would not have come back to The Tonight Show. However, Conan said he did not feel he got shafted. ""It's crucial to me that anyone seeing this, if they take anything away from this, it's I'm fine. I'm doing great,"" said O'Brien. ""I hope people still find me comedically absurd and ridiculous. And I don't regret anything.""[83]","On March 11, 2010, O'Brien announced via his Twitter account that he would embark on a 30-city live tour beginning April 12, 2010, entitled ""The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour"".[84][85] Co-host Andy Richter, along with members of the former Tonight Show Band, joined O'Brien on the tour.[86] Max Weinberg, however, was not able to join,[87] except for a guest appearance at one of Conan's New York City shows.","On April 12, 2010, O'Brien opened his two-month comedy tour in Eugene, Oregon, with a crowd of 2,500 and no TV cameras.

The tour ended in Atlanta on June 14.","On April 12, 2010, just hours before the start of his tour in Eugene, Oregon, O'Brien announced that he would host a new show on cable station TBS.[2] The show debuted on November 8, 2010,[88] and airs Monday through Thursday beginning at 11:00 pm ET/10:00 pm CT. O'Brien's addition moved Lopez Tonight with George Lopez back one hour to midnight ET/11:00 pm CT.[3] Refusing at first to do to Lopez what had happened to him at NBC, O'Brien agreed to join the network after Lopez called to persuade him to come to TBS.[89] In Canada, CTV will air the show[90] and in Turkey, CNBC-e will air the show.","Other networks that were reportedly interested in O'Brien include TBS' sister networks TNT and HBO, Fox, FX, Comedy Central, Showtime, Revision3,[91] and even the NBC Universal–owned USA Network.[92]","On September 1, 2010, O'Brien announced via his Twitter account and Team Coco YouTube page that the title of his new show on TBS would simply be Conan. TBS has recently extended the show through 2018.[93]","In February 2015, following the onset of the Cuban Thaw, O'Brien became the first American television personality to film in Cuba for more than half a century.[94] Conan O'Brien then visited Armenia.[95] In April 2016, O'Brien visited South Korea in response to a fan letter urging him to visit, as well as a growing fan base online. His visit included a trip to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, which resulted in O'Brien and Steven Yeun to also visit North Korea.","In 2004, O'Brien apologized to Canadians for engaging in Quebec bashing, something which some felt reflected prejudice against Francophones.[96] On March 7, 2006, NBC announced a new adventure/comedy series entitled Andy Barker, P.I., starring O'Brien's former sidekick, Andy Richter. O'Brien was executive producer and co-wrote the pilot. After six episodes and low ratings, the show was canceled despite being named by Entertainment Weekly as one of the Top Ten Shows of 2007.[97] USA Network has handed out a 90-minute, cast-contingent pilot order to the medical-themed Operating Instructions from O'Brien's production banner.

He played himself in the season five episode ""Bart Gets Famous"", interviewing Bart Simpson during his rise to fame as a catchphrase comedian. The episode was produced after O'Brien's audition to replace David Letterman, but before he was hired for the show. O'Brien recorded his part after his own show went on the air, though he believed his show would be canceled by the time ""Bart Gets Famous"" aired.[101] In 2006, he voiced himself in a short South Park scene as part of the opening of the 2006 Emmy Awards.

National_Football_League,"The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world.[3] The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.","The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. The NFL agreed to merge with the American Football League (AFL) in 1966, and the first Super Bowl was held at the end of that season; the merger was completed in 1970. Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world[4] and is the most popular sports league in the United States.[5] The Super Bowl is among the biggest club sporting events in the world[6] and individual Super Bowl games account for many of the most watched television programs in American history, all occupying the Nielsen's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015.[7] The NFL's executive officer is the commissioner, who has broad authority in governing the league.","The team with the most NFL championships is the Green Bay Packers with thirteen (nine NFL titles before the Super Bowl era, and four Super Bowl championships afterwards); the team with the most Super Bowl championships is the Pittsburgh Steelers with six. The current NFL champions are the New England Patriots, who defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–28 in Super Bowl LI.",,,"On August 20, 1920, a meeting was held by representatives of the Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Indians, Rock Island Independents and Dayton Triangles at the Jordan and Hupmobile auto showroom in Canton, Ohio.[8] This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group who, according to the Canton Evening Repository, intended to ""raise the standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules"".[9] Another meeting held on September 17, 1920 resulted in the renaming of the league to the American Professional Football Association (APFA).[9] The league hired Jim Thorpe as its first president, and consisted of 14 teams. Only two of these teams, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), remain.[10]","Although the league did not maintain official standings for its 1920 inaugural season and teams played schedules that included non-league opponents, the APFA awarded the Akron Pros the championship by virtue of their 8–0–3 (8 wins, 0 losses, and 3 ties) record.[11] The first event occurred on September 26, 1920 when the Rock Island Independents defeated the non-league St. Paul Ideals 48–0 at Douglas Park.[8][12] On October 3, 1920, the first full week of league play occurred.[13][14] The following season resulted in the Chicago Staleys controversially winning the title over the Buffalo All-Americans.[15] In 1922, the APFA changed its name to the National Football League (NFL).[16]","In 1932, the season ended with the Chicago Bears (6–1–6) and the Portsmouth Spartans (6–1–4) tied for first in the league standings.[17] At the time, teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the highest winning percentage (not including ties, which were not counted towards the standings) at the end of the season was declared the champion; the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie, if two teams played twice in a season, the result of the second game determined the title (the source of the 1921 controversy). This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a playoff game between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to Chicago Stadium, which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9–0 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the de facto championship game led the NFL, beginning in 1933, to split into two divisions with a championship game to be played between the division champions.[18] The 1934 season also marked the first of 12 seasons in which African Americans were absent from the league. The de facto ban was rescinded in 1946, following public pressure and coinciding with the removal of a similar ban in Major League Baseball.[19]","The NFL was always the foremost professional football league in the United States; it nevertheless faced a large number of rival professional leagues through the 1930s and 1940s. Rival leagues included at least three separate American Football Leagues and the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams trace their histories to these rival leagues, including the Los Angeles Rams (who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League), the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers (the last two of which came from the AAFC). By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional football in the United States; its only competition in North America was the professional Canadian football circuit, which formally became the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being a different football code than the American game, the CFL established a niche market in Canada and still survives as an independent league.","A new professional league, the fourth American Football League (AFL), began play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a merger on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the Super Bowl, was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II, and the AFL winning Super Bowl III and Super Bowl IV.[20] After the league merged, it was reorganized into two conferences: the National Football Conference (NFC), consisting of most of the pre-merger NFL teams, and the American Football Conference (AFC), consisting of all of the AFL teams as well as three pre-merger NFL teams.[21]","Today, the NFL is considered the most popular sports league in North America; much of its growth is attributed to former Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who led the league from 1960 to 1989. Overall annual attendance increased from three million at the beginning of his tenure to seventeen million by the end of his tenure, and 400 million viewers watched 1989's Super Bowl XXIII. The NFL established NFL Properties in 1963. The league's licensing wing, NFL Properties earns the league billions of dollars annually; Rozelle's tenure also marked the creation of NFL Charities and a national partnership with United Way.[22] Paul Tagliabue was elected as commissioner to succeed Rozelle; his seventeen-year tenure, which ended in 2006, was marked by large increases in television contracts and the addition of four expansion teams,[23] as well as the introduction of league initiatives to increase the number of minorities in league and team management roles.[24] The league's current Commissioner, Roger Goodell, has focused on reducing the number of illegal hits and making the sport safer, mainly through fining or suspending players who break rules.[25] These actions are among many the NFL is taking to reduce concussions and improve player safety.[26]","From 1920 to 1934, the NFL did not have a set number of games for teams to play, instead setting a minimum. The league mandated a 12-game regular season for each team beginning in 1935, later shortening this to 11 games in 1937 and 10 games in 1943, mainly due to World War II. After the war ended, the number of games returned to 11 games in 1946 and to 12 in 1947. The NFL went to a 14-game schedule in 1961, which it retained until switching to the current 16-game schedule in 1978.[27] Proposals to increase the regular season to 18 games have been made, but have been rejected in labor negotiations with the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA).[28]","The NFL operated in a two-conference system from 1933 to 1966, where the champions of each conference would meet in the NFL Championship Game. If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a one-game playoff to determine the conference champion. In 1967, the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion New Orleans Saints to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions. The four conference champions would meet in the NFL playoffs, a two-round playoff.[29] The NFL also operated the Playoff Bowl (officially the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl) from 1960 to 1969. Effectively a third-place game, pitting the two conference runners-up against each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been exhibitions rather than playoff games. The league discontinued the Playoff Bowl in 1970 due to its perception as a game for losers.[30]","Following the addition of the former AFL teams into the NFL in 1970, the NFL split into two conferences with three divisions each. The expanded league, now with twenty-six teams,[21] would also feature an expanded eight-team eight playoff, the participants being the three division champions from each conference as well as one 'wild card' team (the team with the best win percentage) from each conference. In 1978, the league added a second wild card team from each conference, bringing the total number of playoff teams to ten, and a further two wild card teams were added in 1990 to bring the total to twelve. When the NFL expanded to 32 teams in 2002, the league realigned, changing the division structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in each conference. As each division champion gets a playoff bid, the number of wild card teams from each conference dropped from three to two.[31]","At the corporate level, the National Football League considers itself a trade association made up of and financed by its 32 member teams.[32] Up until 2015, the league was an unincorporated nonprofit 501(c)(6) association.[33] Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption from federal income taxation for ""Business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, boards of trade, or professional football leagues (whether or not administering a pension fund for football players), not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual."".[34] In contrast, each individual team (except the non-profit Green Bay Packers[35]) is subject to tax because they make a profit.[36]","The NFL gave up the tax exempt status in 2015 following public criticism; in a letter to the club owners, Commissioner Roger Goodell labeled it a ""distraction"", saying ""the effects of the tax exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years... Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there. This will remain the case even when the league office and Management Council file returns as taxable entities, and the change in filing status will make no material difference to our business."" As a result, the league office might owe around US$10 million in income taxes, but it is no longer required to disclose the salaries of its executive officers.[37]","The league has three defined officers: the commissioner, secretary, and treasurer. Each conference has one defined officer, the president, which is essentially an honorary position with few powers and mostly ceremonial duties (such as awarding the conference championship trophy).","The commissioner is elected by affirmative vote of two-thirds or 18 (whichever is greater) of the members of the league, while the president of each conference is elected by an affirmative vote of three-fourths or ten of the conference members.[38] The commissioner appoints the secretary and treasurer and has broad authority in disputes between clubs, players, coaches, and employees. He is the ""principal executive officer""[39] of the NFL and also has authority in hiring league employees, negotiating television contracts, disciplining individuals that own part or all of an NFL team, clubs, or employed individuals of an NFL club if they have violated league bylaws or committed ""conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football"".[39] The commissioner can, in the event of misconduct by a party associated with the league, suspend individuals, hand down a fine of up to US$500,000, cancel contracts with the league, and award or strip teams of draft picks.[39]","In extreme cases, the commissioner can offer recommendations to the NFL's Executive Committee up to and including the ""cancellation or forfeiture""[39] of a club's franchise or any other action he deems necessary. The commissioner can also issue sanctions up to and including a lifetime ban from the league if an individual connected to the NFL has bet on games or failed to notify the league of conspiracies or plans to bet on or fix games.[39] The current Commissioner of the National Football League is Roger Goodell, who was elected in 2006 after Paul Tagliabue, the previous commissioner, retired.[40]","According to economist Richard Wolff, the NFL redistributes its wealth to all NFL teams equally in contravention of the typical corporate structure. By redistributing profits to all teams the NFL is ensuring that one team will not dominate the league through excessive earnings. This form of democratic socialism wealth redistribution is practiced by some industrialized countries.[41]","The NFL consists of 32 clubs divided into two conferences of 16 teams in each. Each conference is divided into four divisions of four clubs in each. During the regular season, each team is allowed a maximum of 53 players on its roster;[42] only 46 of these may be active (eligible to play) on game days.[43] Each team can also have a 10-player practice squad separate from its main roster, but the practice squad may only be composed of players who were not active for at least nine games in any of their seasons in the league. A player can only be on a practice squad for a maximum of three seasons.[44]","Each NFL club is granted a franchise, the league's authorization for the team to operate in its home city. This franchise covers 'Home Territory' (the 75 miles surrounding the city limits, or, if the team is within 100 miles of another league city, half the distance between the two cities) and 'Home Marketing Area' (Home Territory plus the rest of the state the club operates in, as well as the area the team operates its training camp in for the duration of the camp). Each NFL member has the exclusive right to host professional football games inside its Home Territory and the exclusive right to advertise, promote, and host events in its Home Marketing Area. There are several exceptions to this rule, mostly relating to teams with close proximity to each other: the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders only have exclusive rights in their cities and share rights outside of it; and teams that operate in the same city (e.g. New York City and Los Angeles) or the same state (e.g. California, Florida, and Texas) share the rights to the city's Home Territory and the state's Home Marketing Area, respectively.[45]","Every NFL team is based in the contiguous United States. Although no team is based in a foreign country, the Jacksonville Jaguars began playing one home game a year at Wembley Stadium in London, England in 2013 as part of the NFL International Series.[46] The Jaguars' agreement with Wembley was originally set to expire in 2016, but has since been extended through 2020.[47] The Buffalo Bills played one home game every season at Rogers Centre in Toronto, Canada as part of the Bills Toronto Series from 2008 to 2013. Mexico also hosted an NFL regular-season game, a 2005 game between the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals known as ""Fútbol Americano"",[48] and 39 international preseason games were played from 1986 to 2005 as part of the American Bowl series.[49] The Raiders and Houston Texans played a game in Mexico City at Estadio Azteca on November 21, 2016.[50]","According to Forbes, the Dallas Cowboys, at approximately US$4 billion, are the most valuable NFL franchise and the most valuable sports team in the world.[51] Also, all 32 NFL teams rank among the Top 50 most valuable sports teams in the world;[52] and 14 of the NFL's owners are listed on the Forbes 400, the most of any sports league or organization.[53]","The NFL season format consists of a four-week preseason, a seventeen-week regular season (each team plays 16 games), and a twelve-team single-elimination playoff culminating in the Super Bowl, the league's championship game.","The NFL preseason begins with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, played at Fawcett Stadium in Canton.[64] Each NFL team is required to schedule four preseason games, two of which must be at its home stadium, but the teams involved in the Hall of Fame game, as well as any teams playing in an American Bowl game, play five preseason games.[65] Preseason games are exhibition matches and do not count towards regular-season totals.[66] Because the preseason does not count towards standings, teams generally do not focus on winning games; instead, they are used by coaches to evaluate their teams and by players to show their performance, both to their current team and to other teams if they get cut.[28] The quality of preseason games has been criticized by some fans, who dislike having to pay full price for exhibition games,[67] as well as by some players and coaches, who dislike the risk of injury the games have, while others have felt the preseason is a necessary part of the NFL season.[28][67]","Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:[68]","The National Football League runs a seventeen-week, 256-game regular season. Since 2001, the season has begun the week after Labor Day and concluded the week after Christmas.[69] The opening game of the season is normally a primetime home game for the league's defending champion.[70]","Most NFL games are played on Sundays, with a Monday night game typically held at least once a week and Thursday night games occurring on most weeks as well.[70] NFL games are not normally played on Fridays or Saturdays until late in the regular season, as federal law prohibits professional football leagues from competing with college or high school football. Because high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days until the third Friday in December.[71] NFL games are rarely scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, and those days have only been used twice since 1948: in 2010, when a Sunday game was rescheduled to Tuesday due to a blizzard, and in 2012, when the Kickoff game was moved from Thursday to Wednesday to avoid conflict with the Democratic National Convention.[72][73]","NFL regular season matchups are determined according to a scheduling formula. Within a division, all four teams play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents – two games (home and away) are played against the other three teams in the division, while one game is held against all the members of a division from the NFC and a division from the AFC as determined by a rotating cycle (three years for the conference the team is in, and four years in the conference they are not in). The other two games are intraconference games, determined by the standings of the previous year – for example, if a team finishes first in its division, it will play two other first-place teams in its conference, while a team that finishes last would play two other last-place teams in the conference.[74] In total, each team plays sixteen games and has one bye week, where they do not play any games.[75]","Although the teams any given club will play are known by the end of the previous year's regular season, the exact dates, times, and home/away status for NFL games are not determined until much later because the league has to account for, among other things, the Major League Baseball postseason and local events that could pose a scheduling conflict with NFL games. During the 2010 season, over 500,000 potential schedules were created by computers, 5,000 of which were considered ""playable schedules"" and were reviewed by the NFL's scheduling team. After arriving at what they felt was the best schedule out of the group, nearly 50 more potential schedules were developed to try and ensure that the chosen schedule would be the best possible one.[76]","Following the conclusion of the regular season, a twelve-team single elimination tournament, the NFL Playoffs, is held. Six teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the four divisions as well as two wild card teams (the two remaining teams with the best overall record). These teams are seeded according to overall record, with the division champions always ranking higher than either of the wild card teams.[77] The top two teams (seeded one and two) from each conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining four teams (seeded 3–6) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the Wild Card round, with the third seed competing against the sixth seed and the fourth seed competing against the fifth seed. The winners of the Wild Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded team against the first seed and the higher seeded team against the second seed. The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed. The AFC and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league champion.","The only other postseason event hosted by the NFL is the Pro Bowl, the league's all-star game. Since 2009, the Pro Bowl has been held the week before the Super Bowl; in previous years, the game was held the week following the Super Bowl, but in an effort to boost ratings, the game was moved to the week before.[78] Because of this, players from the teams participating in the Super Bowl are exempt from participating in the game. The Pro Bowl is not considered as competitive as a regular-season game because the biggest concern of teams is to avoid injuries to the players.[79]","The National Football League has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence. The first trophy, the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup, was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the Brunswick-Balke Collender Corporation. The trophy, the appearance of which is only known by its description as a ""silver loving cup"", was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles. The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 1920 season; however, the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts are unknown.[80]","A second trophy, the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, was issued by the NFL from 1934 to 1969. The trophy's namesake, Ed Thorp, was a referee in the league and a friend to many early league owners; upon his death in 1934, the league created the trophy to honor him. In addition to the main trophy, which would be in the possession of the current league champion, the league issued a smaller replica trophy to each champion, who would maintain permanent control over it. The current location of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, like that of its predecessor, is unknown. The predominant theory is that the Minnesota Vikings, the last team to be awarded the trophy, somehow misplaced it after the 1969 season.[81]","The current trophy of the NFL is the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Super Bowl trophy was officially renamed in 1970 after Vince Lombardi, who as head coach led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls. Unlike the previous trophies, a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is issued to each year's champion, who maintains permanent control of it. Lombardi Trophies are made by Tiffany & Co. out of sterling silver and are worth anywhere from US$25,000 to US$300,000.[82] Additionally, each player on the winning team as well as coaches and personnel are awarded Super Bowl rings to commemorate their victory. The winning team chooses the company that makes the rings; each ring design varies, with the NFL mandating certain ring specifications (which have a degree of room for deviation), in addition to requiring the Super Bowl logo be on at least one side of the ring.[83] The losing team are also awarded rings, which must be no more than half as valuable as the winners' rings, but those are almost never worn.[84]","The conference champions receive trophies for their achievement. The champions of the NFC receive the George Halas Trophy,[85] named after Chicago Bears founder George Halas, who is also considered as one of the co-founders of the NFL. The AFC champions receive the Lamar Hunt Trophy,[86] named after Lamar Hunt, the founder of the Kansas City Chiefs and the principal founder of the American Football League. Players on the winning team also receive a conference championship ring.[87][88]","The NFL recognizes a number of awards for its players and coaches at its annual NFL Honors presentation. The most prestigious award is the AP Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.[89] Other major awards include the AP Offensive Player of the Year, AP Defensive Player of the Year, AP Comeback Player of the Year, and the AP Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards.[90] Another prestigious award is the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which recognizes a player's off-field work in addition to his on-field performance.[91] The NFL Coach of the Year award is the highest coaching award.[92] The NFL also gives out weekly awards such as the FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week[93] and the Pepsi MAX NFL Rookie of the Week awards.[94]","In the United States, the National Football League has television contracts with four networks: CBS, ESPN, Fox, and NBC. Collectively, these contracts cover every regular season and postseason game. In general, CBS televises afternoon games in which the away team is an AFC team, and Fox carries afternoon games in which the away team belongs to the NFC. These afternoon games are not carried on all affiliates, as multiple games are being played at once; each network affiliate is assigned one game per time slot, according to a complicated set of rules.[95] Since 2011, the league has reserved the right to give Sunday games that, under the contract, would normally air on one network to the other network (known as ""flexible scheduling"").[96] The only way to legally watch a regionally televised game not being carried on the local network affiliates is to purchase NFL Sunday Ticket, the league's out-of-market sports package, which is only available to subscribers to the DirecTV satellite service. The league also provides RedZone, an omnibus telecast that cuts to the most relevant plays in each game, live as they happen.","In addition to the regional games, the league also has packages of telecasts, mostly in prime time, that are carried nationwide. CBS also carries a package of five games on Thursday nights. NBC broadcasts the primetime Sunday Night Football package and seven Thursday night games, which includes the NFL Kickoff game that starts the regular season and a primetime Thanksgiving Day game. ESPN carries all Monday Night Football games.[95] The NFL's own network, NFL Network, carries all Thursday Night Football games, including those on CBS and NBC (except the Thanksgiving and kickoff games, which remain exclusive to NBC).[97]","The Super Bowl television rights are rotated on a three-year basis between CBS, Fox, and NBC.[95] In 2011, all four stations signed new nine-year contracts with the NFL, each running until 2022; CBS, Fox, and NBC are estimated by Forbes to pay a combined total of US$3 billion a year, while ESPN will pay US$1.9 billion a year.[98] The league also has deals with Spanish-language broadcasters NBC Universo, Fox Deportes, and ESPN Deportes, which air Spanish language dubs of their respective English-language sister networks' games.[99][100] The league's contracts do not cover preseason games, which individual teams are free to sell to local stations directly; a minority of preseason games are distributed among the league's national television partners.","Through the 2014 season, the NFL had a blackout policy in which games were 'blacked out' on local television in the home team's area if the home stadium was not sold out. Clubs could elect to set this requirement at only 85%, but they would have to give more ticket revenue to the visiting team; teams could also request a specific exemption from the NFL for the game. The vast majority of NFL games were not blacked out; only 6% of games were blacked out during the 2011 season,[101] and only two games were blacked out in 2013 and none in 2014.[102] The NFL announced in March 2015 that it would suspend its blackout policy for at least the 2015 season.[102] According to Nielsen, the NFL regular season since 2012 was watched by at least 200 million individuals, accounting for 80% of all television households in the United States and 69% of all potential viewers in the United States. NFL regular season games accounted for 31 out of the top 32 most-watched programs in the fall season and an NFL game ranked as the most-watched television show in all 17 weeks of the regular season. At the local level, NFL games were the highest-ranked shows in NFL markets 92% of the time.[103] Super Bowls account for the 22 most-watched programs (based on total audience) in US history, including a record 167 million people that watched Super Bowl XLVIII, the conclusion to the 2013 season.[104]","In addition to radio networks run by each NFL team, select NFL games are broadcast nationally by Westwood One (known as Dial Global for the 2012 season). These games are broadcast on over 500 networks, giving all NFL markets access to each primetime game. The NFL's deal with Westwood One was extended in 2012 and will run through 2017.[105]","Some broadcasting innovations have either been introduced or popularized during NFL telecasts. Among them, the Skycam camera system was used for the first time in a live telecast, at a 1984 preseason NFL game in San Diego between the Chargers and 49ers, and televised by CBS.[106] Commentator John Madden famously used a telestrator during games between the early 1980s to the mid-2000s, boosting the device's popularity.[107]","The NFL, as a one-time experiment, distributed the October 25, 2015 International Series game from Wembley Stadium in London between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars. The game was live streamed on the Internet exclusively via Yahoo!, except for over-the-air broadcasts on the local CBS-TV affiliates in the Buffalo and Jacksonville markets.[108][109][110]","In 2015, the NFL began sponsoring a series of public service announcements to bring attention to domestic abuse and sexual assault in response to what was seen as poor handling of incidents of violence by players.[111] ","Each April (excluding 2014 when it took place in May), the NFL holds a draft of college players. The draft consists of seven rounds, with each of the 32 clubs getting one pick in each round.[112] The draft order for non-playoff teams is determined by regular-season record; among playoff teams, teams are first ranked by the furthest round of the playoffs they reached, and then are ranked by regular-season record. For example, any team that reached the divisional round will be given a higher pick than any team that reached the conference championships, but will be given a lower pick than any team that did not make the divisional round. The Super Bowl champion always drafts last, and the losing team from the Super Bowl always drafts next-to-last.[113] All potential draftees must be at least three years removed from high school in order to be eligible for the draft.[114] Underclassmen that have met that criterion to be eligible for the draft must write an application to the NFL by January 15 renouncing their remaining college eligibility.[115] Clubs can trade away picks for future draft picks, but cannot trade the rights to players they have selected in previous drafts.[116]","Aside from the 32 picks each club gets, compensatory draft picks are given to teams that have lost more compensatory free agents than they have gained. These are spread out from rounds 3 to 7, and a total of 32 are given.[117] Clubs are required to make their selection within a certain period of time, the exact time depending on which round the pick is made in. If they fail to do so on time, the clubs behind them can begin to select their players in order, but they do not lose the pick outright. This happened in the 2003 draft, when the Minnesota Vikings failed to make their selection on time. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers were able to make their picks before the Vikings were able to use theirs.[118] Selected players are only allowed to negotiate contracts with the team that picked them, but if they choose not to sign they become eligible for the next year's draft.[119] Under the current collective bargaining contract, all contracts to drafted players must be four-year deals with a club option for a fifth. Contracts themselves are limited to a certain amount of money, depending on the exact draft pick the player was selected with.[120] Players who were draft eligible but not picked in the draft are free to sign with any club.[112]","The NFL operates several other drafts in addition to the NFL draft. The league holds a supplemental draft annually. Clubs submit emails to the league stating the player they wish to select and the round they will do so, and the team with the highest bid wins the rights to that player. The exact order is determined by a lottery held before the draft, and a successful bid for a player will result in the team forfeiting the rights to its pick in the equivalent round of the next NFL draft.[121] Players are only eligible for the supplemental draft after being granted a petition for special eligibility.[122] The league holds expansion drafts, the most recent happening in 2002 when the Houston Texans began play as an expansion team.[123] Other drafts held by the league include an allocation draft in 1950 to allocate players from several teams that played in the dissolved All-America Football Conference[124] and a supplemental draft in 1984 to give NFL teams the rights to players who had been eligible for the main draft but had not been drafted because they had signed contracts with the United States Football League or Canadian Football League.[125]","Like the other major sports leagues in the United States, the NFL maintains protocol for a disaster draft. In the event of a 'near disaster' (less than 15 players killed or disabled) that caused the club to lose a quarterback, they could draft one from a team with at least three quarterbacks. In the event of a 'disaster' (15 or more players killed or disabled) that results in a club's season being cancelled, a restocking draft would be held. Neither of these protocols has ever had to be implemented.[126]","Free agents in the National Football League are divided into restricted free agents, who have three accrued seasons and whose current contract has expired, and unrestricted free agents, who have four or more accrued seasons and whose contract has expired. An accrued season is defined as ""six or more regular-season games on a club's active/inactive, reserved/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists"".[127] Restricted free agents are allowed to negotiate with other clubs besides their former club, but the former club has the right to match any offer. If they choose not to, they are compensated with draft picks. Unrestricted free agents are free to sign with any club, and no compensation is owed if they sign with a different club.[127]","Clubs are given one franchise tag to offer to any unrestricted free agent. The franchise tag is a one-year deal that pays the player 120% of his previous contract or no less than the average of the five highest-paid players at his position, whichever is greater. There are two types of franchise tags: exclusive tags, which do not allow the player to negotiate with other clubs, and non-exclusive tags, which allow the player to negotiate with other clubs but gives his former club the right to match any offer and two first-round draft picks if they decline to match it.[128]","Clubs also have the option to use a transition tag, which is similar to the non-exclusive franchise tag but offers no compensation if the former club refuses to match the offer.[129] Due to that stipulation, the transition tag is rarely used,[130] even with the removal of the ""poison pill"" strategy (offering a contract with stipulations that the former club would be unable to match) that essentially ended the usage of the tag league-wide.[131] Each club is subject to a salary cap, which is set at US$143.28 million for the 2015 season, US$10 million more than in 2014 and US$20 million more than in 2013.[132]","Members of clubs' practice squads, despite being paid by and working for their respective clubs, are also simultaneously a kind of free agent and are able to sign to any other club's active roster (provided their new club is not their previous club's next opponent within a set number of days) without compensation to their previous club; practice squad players cannot be signed to other clubs' practice squads, however, unless released by their original club first.[133]",Explanatory notes,Citations,Bibliography

Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge,[14][16][17] and Simon Cowell have both claimed to have come up with the idea of forming the band. In 2013, Cowell said that it ""took him 10 minutes to put them together as a group"".[18] Subsequently, the group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice.[19][20] Styles came up with the name One Direction.[19] For their qualifying song at ""judges' houses"", and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of ""Torn"".[21] Cowell later commented that their performance convinced him that they ""were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.""[22] Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were his last act in the competition.[23] The group quickly gained popularity in the UK.[22]","One Direction achieved third place in the competition and immediately after the final, their song ""Forever Young"", which would have been released if they had won The X Factor, was leaked onto the internet.[24] Shortly afterwards it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported £2 million Syco Records record contract.[25][26] Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with RedOne, a record producer.[27] A book licensed by One Direction, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), was published by HarperCollins in February 2011,[28] subsequently topping The Sunday Times Best Seller list.[29] The same month, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour.[30] During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK.[31] After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album.[27] Recording took place in Stockholm, London and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, and Rami Yacoub, among others.[32][33]","Released in September 2011, One Direction's debut single, ""What Makes You Beautiful"", reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, after becoming the most pre-ordered Sony Music Entertainment single in history.[34][35] Subsequent singles, ""Gotta Be You"" and ""One Thing"", peaked in the UK Singles Chart top ten.[36][37] In November 2011, they signed a record deal with Columbia Records in North America.[38] Steve Barnett, the co-chairman of Columbia Records, said it was not a difficult decision to sign One Direction; ""I just thought there was a void, and maybe they could seize and hold it.""[39] ""What Makes You Beautiful"" was released in the United States in February 2012,[40] where it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 28, becoming the highest debut for a British act since 1998.[41] It has sold over 4 million copies in the US[42] Upon arrival in the US in February 2012, One Direction embarked on a radio promotion spree, as well as their first North American concert tour as an opening act for Big Time Rush.[43][44] They made their first US television appearance on The Today Show, at the Rockefeller Center; an estimated 15,000 fans descended on the plaza.[45] Critically commended for its appeal to the teenage audience,[46][47][48] One Direction's first studio album, Up All Night, was released globally in early 2012.

There was no need to worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show.""[162] Herald Sun's Cameron Adams opined that One Direction have ""strong pop voices"".[163] Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, ""It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere in the midst of all the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain.""[164] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: ""What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert.""[165] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: ""As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out.""[166] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's ""surprisingly accomplished effort"" of Kings of Leon's ""Use Somebody"" proved that One Direction are ""more than capable"" of evolving their sound.[167]","Their third album Midnight Memories (2013) is a pop rock record, a slight departure from the band's original teen pop sound. Liam Payne called Midnight Memories a ""slightly rockier and edgier"" album than their previous material. The album is heavily influenced by 80's rock[168] and folk music and briefly integrates elements of dubstep, notably in ""Little White Lies"". The album's lyrical themes primarily revolve around love, heartbreak and sexual intercourse. Many critics praised its lyrical depth and musical composition, as well as the group's level of involvement in the production process.[169]","Their fourth album Four (2014) was released on 17 November 2014. Payne once again claimed that the album would be ""edgier"" and that the group had written most of the songs for it; Horan came up with the name of the album, commemorating the fact that it is One Direction's fourth record to date and that it has been four years since the band's formation.[170] Signifying a further maturation of their pop sound, the album's first single, Steal My Girl, was dubbed by Billboard as ""no What Makes You Beautiful, but its Coldplay-like piano pop could be a good direction"",[171] and that the band was ""not entirely ready to let go of its bubble-gum days"". Rolling Stone described the record as ""saturated with retro vibes""; its songs ""split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone did last year.""[172]","In 2011, the band performed on the BBC's Children in Need 2011 charity telethon, helping raise over 26 million pounds.[173] In 2012 they extended their involvement with Children in Need as they opened the telecast with a performance of their single ""Live While We're Young"". A prominent annual event in British culture, the group said it was ""incredible"" to be involved in Children in Need as it was something that they had ""always watched as children"".[174]","In February 2013, One Direction released ""One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)"" (a medley of ""One Way or Another"" and ""Teenage Kicks"") as the 2013 single for the UK's other major charity telethon Comic Relief.[92] For ITV's Santa charity Christmas campaign, they filmed a set of pleas to their fans and the general public, asking them to donate £2.[175] The band have made numerous other appearances for charitable causes, including the 2011 Pride of Britain Awards where they presented 13-year-old quadruple amputee Danielle Bailey the Child of Courage award at her school assembly, and the 2014 Royal Variety Performance where they played in front of Prince William and Catherine at the London Palladium.[176][177]","In September 2012, Niall Horan organised an event to raise money for Irish Autism Action and another charity, called Temporary Emergency Accommodation Mullingar, based in his hometown. Due to overwhelming demand to participate in the fundraising, the ticket website for the event broke down. Horan's brother Greg commented on the website crash, saying that ""there were 500 tickets and they were all snapped up pretty quick"".[178]","In 2013, band members Liam Payne and Harry Styles partnered with Trekstock, a leading cancer charity to help raise money for cancer research.[179] As ambassadors of the charity, the duo collaborated to offer the chance for one fan and a friend to win an evening out with them in return for a donation to the charity as part of an exclusive ""#HangwithLiam&Harry"" global campaign. They had originally set a goal of raising $500,000 and ended up raising $784,984. Trekstock later added that this amount would allow them to ""complete funding of their Hodgkin's lymphoma trial, in the hope of offering a much brighter future to thousands of children and young people affected by this form of disease.""

And what could be better than one cute boy, if not five?""[183] One Direction have been described as sparking a resurgence in the interest in boy bands, and as forming part of a new ""British Invasion"" in the United States.[184][185][186][187][188][189] Bill Werde, a representative of Billboard magazine, commented, ""There's a lot of possibility here, there's a lot of upside, that level of talent with those kinds of looks, it's really a perfect storm for a massive, massive successful phenomenon.""[190]","Sonny Takhar, the chief executive officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media.

Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before.""[190] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, ""These guys live online, and so do their fans.""[189] Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, ""which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans,"" according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian.[190] One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day.[191] In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is ""the cute one"", Malik is ""the quiet and mysterious one"", Payne is ""the sensible one"", Styles is ""the charming one"" and Tomlinson is ""the funny one"".[192] Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, ""At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing."" Instead, her original idea was for them to be the ""male equivalent to the Spice Girls"", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style.[193] Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, ""People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [being] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean.""[194] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front,[194] ""For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys – posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows.""[194] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, ""One Direction fulfil a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here"".[195]",Headlining,Opening act,"One Direction has received five BRIT Awards—winning their first with ""What Makes You Beautiful"" for Best British Single at the 2012 BRIT Awards,[198] three NME awards,[199] two Kids' Choice Awards,[200] and four MTV Video Music Awards,[72] among other awards.

Summer 2012 Guetta played in Finland in Weekend Festival and he will be festival's headliner also for year 2013.[32] The third single from Nothing but the Beat 2.0 is ""Play Hard""","Nothing But the Beat[33] is a feature-length biographical documentary about Guetta's rise to fame, featuring many of his collaborators, including Kelly Rowland, will.i.am and Snoop Dogg. It was financed by the energy drink, burn, with whom Guetta became a brand ambassador from 2011. Together with burn, Guetta also provided support and mentoring for the burn-sponsored ""burn studios residency"" program[34] for up-and-coming DJs.","Guetta also wrote, produced, and featured on Rihanna's seventh studio album, Unapologetic, and acts as the support act for the European leg of her ongoing Diamonds World Tour.","In 2012, Guetta created a new record label known as Jack Back Records, where he intends to focus only on electronic music releases (compared to the dance pop productions he's most known for).[35][36] The label is named after a project Guetta started alongside Nicky Romero when they remixed the song ""Wild Ones"". The premiere release of the new label was ""Metropolis"", another one of his collaboration with Romero, which also became a track from Nothing but the Beat 2.0. The label also included releases from the likes of Daddy's Groove and other collaborators, as well as a two-track EP from production duo Spencer & Hill. All of the label's releases can be found on Beatport.[37]","While on tour with Rihanna, he debuted his new track at Twickenham Stadium on 15 June 2013.

Guetta released the artwork for his new single on his Instagram profile on 19 June 2013.","In September, Guetta unveiled the music video for new track ""One Voice"" featuring indie singer Mikky Ekko. It was released on 4 November as part of the UN's humanitarian campaign called The World Needs More.[39]","Guetta co-wrote and produced the song ""Fashion!"" on Lady Gaga's third studio album Artpop. He also had songwriting and production contributions to Britney Spears' eighth studio album Britney Jean, on multiple tracks and instrumentation imitations.","On 20 January 2014, Guetta released ""Shot Me Down"" featuring American singer Skylar Grey. It is an adaption of the Cher song ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"". The song was co-produced by Giorgio Tuinfort.","In February, Guetta released a remix of Avicii's track ""Addicted to You"" on Beatport. Later that month, record label Cherrytree hinted through a message on Twitter that English singer-songwriter Natalia Kills was in a studio in Stockholm, Sweden, along with Guetta and Giorgio Tuinfort to record a new song.[40] The trio was later joined by DJ Afrojack, and Avicii.[41] On 17 March 2014, he released ""Bad"", a collaboration with Showtek and Vassy on Jack Back Records, and released his remix of Afrojack's single ""Ten Feet Tall"" on 15 April.","Guetta released ""Blast Off"", with Kaz James on 14 June.

FC_Barcelona,"Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔɫ ˈkɫub bərsəˈɫonə] ( listen)), commonly known as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça,[note 1] is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.","Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto ""Més que un club"" (English: ""More than a club""). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.56 billion, and the world's second richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €560.8 million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is the ""Cant del Barça"", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4]","Domestically, Barcelona has won 24 La Liga, 28 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de España, 3 Copa Eva Duarte and 2 Copa de la Liga trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, Barcelona has won five European titles — four UEFA Champions League titles and one European Cup, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, a shared record five UEFA Super Cup, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and a record three FIFA Club World Cup.[5] Barcelona was ranked first in the IFFHS Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015[6][7] and currently occupies the third position on the UEFA club rankings.[8] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid; matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.","Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[9][10] Barcelona players have won a record number of Ballon d'Or awards (11), with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record number of FIFA World Player of the Year awards (7), with winners including Ronaldo, Romário and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football school.","Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, completing the sextuple in also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[11] In 2011, the club became European champions again and won five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won 14 trophies in just 4 years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[12][13][14] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy on 6 June 2015, Barcelona became the first European club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.",,,"On 22 October 1899, Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended — Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons — and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.[16]","FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya in the final.[17] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, ""Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.""[18] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[19]","On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.[20]","With the new stadium, Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the Pyrenees Cup, which, at the time, consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[21] From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played an integral part of the four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.[22] The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals Espanyol won.[23]","During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.[24] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa: Barcelona won 6–2.[25]","Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[26] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[27]","Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups and enjoyed its first ""golden age"".[17][19]","On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[28] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.[26] On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.[25] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled ""Oda a Platko"", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[29] On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[19]","Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[30] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936 and 1938,[17] success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them.","A month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[31] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[32] He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[33] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[34][35]","On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.[36][37] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the ""undisciplined"" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de Fútbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[38]","In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1.[39] According to football writer Sid Lowe, ""There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.""[40] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.[41]","Despite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[42] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[43] In June 1950, Barcelona signed László Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[44]","On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[45][46]","Coach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.[27]","With Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final.[47][48]","The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[48] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.[49][50]","The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[51] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son ""Jordi"", after the local Catalan Saint George.[52] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960,[17] defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[53]","In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[56][57]","On 16 May 1979, the club won its first European Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.[58]","In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.[59] In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua București during a dramatic evening in Seville.[56]","Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.[60] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[61]","After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top-scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[56]","In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club as manager and he assembled the so-called ""Dream Team"".[62] He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário and Hristo Stoichkov.[63]",,"It was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was previous Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.[64] Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[65] Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure.[56] On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state, ""Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it.""[66]","Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall.[67] The objective of the group, called L'Elefant Blau, was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.[67][68] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.[69]","Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de España. Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[70]","Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Internazionale. However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.[70]","The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[73] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[74]",,"After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, and Rafael Márquez, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[75]","In the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[76] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.[77]","Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[78] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[79] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[80] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.","Barcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.[81]",,"Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.[81] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.","Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions. Barça finished the season by beating the previous year's Champions League winners Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to win their third Champions League title and completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.[83][84][85] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao[86] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[87] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup,[88] and became the first football club ever to accomplish the sextuple.[89] Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.[90][91]",,"After Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he got 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes.[92] Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million[93] and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million.[94]","At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of which were Barcelona players whom started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.[95]","In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival, Real Madrid 5–0 in El Clásico. In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points.[96] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[97] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup.[98] In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.[99]","Later the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup after defeating Porto 2–0 thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Cesc Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies.[100] The Super Cup victory also marked another impressive achievement as Pep Guardiola won his 12th trophy out of 15 possible in only three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.[101]","In December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas.[102] As a result, the overall trophy title during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of 24 possible in four years, continuing their high-quality performance in recent world football competitions.[103][104]","In the 2011–12 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Right afterward, coach Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections,[105][106] announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova.[107][108] Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.[109]","It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March.[110] They reached the semifinal stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.[111]","On 22 July 2013, Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.[112] Barcelona's first official games under Martino were the home and away legs of the 2013 Supercopa de España, which Barça won 1–1 on away goals. On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of the complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar. Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term in 2016.","In April 2014, FIFA banned the club from buying players for the next two transfer windows following the violation of the FIFA's rules about the transfer of footballers aged under 18.[113] A statement on FIFA's website read, ""With regard to the case in question, FC Barcelona has been found to be in breach of art. 19 of the Regulations in the case of ten minor players and to have committed several other concurrent infringements in the context of other players, including under Annexe 2 of the Regulations. The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, together with a fine of CHF 450,000. Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned.""[114] FIFA rejected an appeal in August but the pending appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport allowed Barcelona to sign players during the summer of 2014.[115]","On 17 May, in a game where they needed to defeat Atlético Madrid (who had eliminated them from the Champions League in the quarter-finals earlier in the year) to be crowned champions of La Liga for the 23rd time, they drew after Atlético defender Diego Godín headed in the equaliser in the 49th minute, giving Atlético the championship.[116]","Two days later, it was announced that Luis Enrique would return to Barcelona as head coach, after he agreed to a two-year deal. He was recommended by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, his former national teammate.[117][118] Following Enrique's arrival, Barcelona broke their transfer record when they paid Liverpool between €81 to €94 million for striker Luis Suárez,[119][120] who was serving a four-month ban from all football-related activity imposed by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during his appearance for Uruguay in a World Cup group stage match.[121][122][123]",,"In late December, Barcelona's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was unsuccessful and the original transfer ban was reinstated, leaving the club unable to utilise the 2015 winter and summer transfer windows.[115] On 5 January 2015, Zubizareta was sacked by the board after four years as director of football.[124] The next month, Barcelona announced the formation of a new Football Area Technical Commission, made up of vice-president Jordi Mestre, board member Javier Bordas, Carles Rexach and Ariedo Braida.[125]","Barcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[126] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid.[127] This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[128] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[129] On 6 June, Barcelona won the Champions League final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years.[130] Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed ""MSN"", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[131]","On 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament.[132] The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly.[133][134] By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014.[135]","On 4 January 2016, Barcelona's transfer ban ended. The same day, they registered 77 players across all categories and ages, and both last summer signings Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal became eligible to play with the first team.[136] On 10 February, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey.[137][138] With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season.[139][140] After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, the run has ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou.[141] On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons with a 3–0 win in the final day of the season at Granada.[142] On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League in 2nd Leg, beating Paris Saint-Germain by a score of 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[143]","The nickname culé for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand. In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.[144] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.[145] The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009,[146] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.[147][148]","In addition to membership, as of 2015[update] there are 1,267 officially registered fan clubs, called penyes, around the world.[149] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.[150] Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 90 million Facebook fans as of February 2016.[9][151][152] The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.[153][154] Barcelona has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund.[155][156]","There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Clásico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[157]","During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) and especially of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned.[158][159] Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barça became 'More than a club' (Més que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barça. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence.[160] During Franco's regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.[161]","On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond: Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War.[162][163] During the Spanish Civil War, however, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.","During the 1950s, the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano, who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success.[164] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice in a controversial knock-out round of the European Cup, with Madrid receiving unfavourable treatment from the referee.[165][166] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the ""Match of The Century"" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people.[167]","Barça's local rival has always been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[168] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.[169] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.[170][171]","Traditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit.[172] Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.[173]","In 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.[168] Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.[168]","Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 81 seasons (1928–2016) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on six occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992 and 2016). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[174]","Barcelona's rival in European football is Italian club A.C. Milan.[175][176][177][178] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the second most played match in European competitions after Bayern Munich – Real Madrid (22).[179][180] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups.[181] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the first and third most decorated teams in world football, with 20 and 18 titles respectively.[182]","Barcelona leads the Head-To-Head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona).[183] While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they've beaten Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs.[184][185] In 2013, however, Barcelona made a ""historic"" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League, winning 4–0 at the Camp Nou.[186][187]","Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[188] The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[189] As of 2016[update] the club has 140,000 socis.[190]","In 2010, Forbes evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[191][192] According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue.[193] In 2013, Forbes magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion.[194] In 2014, Forbes ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million.[3][195]","Xavi presently holds the team record for most number of total games played (767) and the record number of La Liga appearances (505), Andrés Iniesta comes second with 626 in all competitions and 409 in the League.","Barcelona's all-time highest goalscorer in all competitions (including friendlies) is Lionel Messi with 534 goals, surpassing Paulino Alcántara's record (369 goals) held for 87 years,[196] as well as being the highest goalscorer in official competitions with 504 goals. He is also the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European (97 goals) and international club competitions (102 goals), and the record league scorer with 345 goals in La Liga. Alongside Messi, three other players have managed to score over 100 league goals at Barcelona: César (190), László Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto'o (108). Josep Samitier is the club's highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 65 goals.","László Kubala holds La Liga record of most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting de Gijón in 1952.[197] Lionel Messi, with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012, has the Champions League record.[198] Eulogio Martínez became Barça's top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957.","Barcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each. Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record,[199] and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona.[200] Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history (754 minutes).[201][202]","Barcelona's longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917–1924) and (1931–1933), and Pep Guardiola is the club's most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona players are Andrés Iniesta and Messi (29 trophies), surpassing Xavi (25 trophies).[203]","Barcelona's Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.[204] The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.[205]","El Barça de les Cinc Copes is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952).[206][207][208] Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955.[209][210] On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve the continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever football team to complete the sextuple.[211][212] On July 2014, Barcelona signed Luis Suárez from Liverpool for about £75 million, the highest transfer fee in club history.[213][214] In 2016, the club set a Spanish record for most consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions (39).[139] One year later the record was broken by Real Madrid (40).[215][216]",Barcelona's La Masia is ranked by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the academy that produces more top-level players than any other academy in the world.[217][218][219],"The club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[20] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[20]","The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.[221] Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and red design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.[222] The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used.","Prior to the 2011–2012 season, Barcelona had a long history of avoiding corporate sponsorship on the playing shirts. On 14 July 2006, the club announced a five-year agreement with UNICEF, which includes having the UNICEF logo on their shirts. The agreement had the club donate €1.5 million per year to UNICEF (0.7% of its ordinary income, equal to the UN International Aid Target, cf. ODA) via the FC Barcelona Foundation.[226] The FC Barcelona Foundation is an entity set up in 1994 on the suggestion of then-chairman of the Economical-Statutory Committee, Jaime Gil-Aluja. The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract financial sponsorships to support a non-profit sport company.[227] In 2004, a company could become one of 25 ""Honorary members"" by contributing between £40,000–60,000 (£55,400–83,100)[228] per year. There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of £14,000 (£19,400)[228] and an unlimited number of ""patronages"" for the cost of £4,000 per year (£5,500).[228] It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy, but according to the author Anthony King, it is ""unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club"".[229]","Barcelona ended their refusal of corporate sponsorship prior to the commencement of the 2011–12 season, signing a five-year, €150 million deal with Qatar Sports Investments, that meant the Qatar Foundation[230] was on the club's shirt for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, then replaced by Qatar Airways for the 2013–14 season, the deal allowing for a commercial sponsor logo to replace the charity logo, two years into the six-year deal.[231] The deal with Qatar Airways was extended for one more year in 2016.[232]","Barcelona initially played in the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.[233]","In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.[234]","After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.[234][235][236] The club began to make plans for a new stadium.[234] The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.[234]","In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.[237][238][239] In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.[240] It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.[1]","There are also other facilities, which include:[241]","Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries—countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement—are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.",Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Eminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records, with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent. Eminem has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, he starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, for ""Lose Yourself"", becoming the first rap artist to win the award.[2] Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), The Interview (2014) and the television series Entourage (2010).",,,"Eminem was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers, Jr. (born June 30, 1951; known as Bruce) and Deborah Rae ""Debbie"" Nelson (born January 6, 1955).[3][4][5] Debbie was 14 when she met 18-year-old Bruce;[5] at age 17, she nearly died during her 73-hour labor.[6] Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before their separation. Bruce left the family, moving to California[7] and having two other children: Michael and Sarah (born c. 1982).[8] Debbie had son Nathan ""Nate"" Kane Samara on February 3, 1986.[5] During his childhood, Eminem and Debbie shuttled between Michigan and Missouri, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members. In Missouri, they lived in several places, including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City.[9][10]","As a teenager Eminem wrote letters to his father; according to Debbie, all came back marked ""return to sender"".[7] Friends and family remember Eminem as a happy child, but ""a bit of a loner"" who was often bullied. One bully, De'Angelo Bailey, severely injured Eminem's head; Debbie filed a lawsuit against the school in 1982, which was dismissed the following year.[6] Eminem spent much of his youth in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood.[7] He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten by black youths several times.[7] As a child he was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic-book artist before discovering hip hop.[11] Eminem heard his first rap song (""Reckless"", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronnie Polkinghorn, who later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkinghorn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking for days and did not attend his funeral.[7][12]","Eminem's home life was seldom stable; he frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a ""very suspicious, almost paranoid personality"". When her son became famous, Debbie was unimpressed by suggestions that she was a less-than-ideal mother, contending that she sheltered him and was responsible for his success. In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Ann ""Kim"" Scott to stay at their home; several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott.[6] After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades,[13] he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although he was interested in English, he never explored literature (preferring comic books) and disliked math and social studies.[14] Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, later maintaining that she often threw him out of the house anyway. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.[7]","At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names ""Manix"" and ""M&M"", the latter of which evolved into ""Eminem"".[1][6] Eminem sneaked into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles.[15] On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile, considered ""ground zero"" for the Detroit rap scene.[7] Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences.[1][16][17] When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable.[14] Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.[14]","As Eminem's reputation grew, he was recruited by several rap groups; the first was the New Jacks. After they disbanded he joined Soul Intent, who released a single on their 1995 self-titled EP featuring Proof.[1] Eminem and Proof then teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released their first album Devil's Night in 2001.[7] Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.[6]","Eminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass's FBT Productions, and recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label.[18] The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996.[19] One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known.[20] Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite, and the feedback Eminem did receive (""Why don't you go into rock and roll?"") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.[7] At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood, and their house was robbed several times.[7] Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores.[21] His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie's birth.[6] He was fired shortly before Christmas, and later said, ""It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie's birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.""[7] After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt.[1] By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert's Lodge for the last time, and lived in his mother's mobile home with Kim and Hailie.[6]","Eminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape, and murder.[6] In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment.[7] The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism.[1] Hip-hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its ""Unsigned Hype"" column in March 1998.[22]","After he was evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, an annual, nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second, and Interscope Records staff in attendance sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip-hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, ""In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'"" Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, he was confident in his decision: ""I don't give a fuck if you're purple; if you can kick it, I'm working with you.""[7] Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager, and was nervous about working with him on an album: ""I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.""[23] He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.[24]","Eminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year's most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year),[25] he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage.[26][27] The album's popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife's body, and in ""Guilty Conscience"" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. Guilty Conscience marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (""Forgot About Dre"" and ""What's the Difference"" from Dr. Dre's album 2001, ""Bitch Please II"" from The Marshall Mathers LP, ""Say What You Say"" from The Eminem Show, ""Encore/Curtains Down"" from Encore, and ""Old Time's Sake"" and ""Crack a Bottle"" from Relapse), and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem's Aftermath albums.[28] The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.[29]","The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1,760,000 copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album.[30][31] The first single from the album, ""The Real Slim Shady"", was a success despite controversies about Eminem's insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Fred Durst and Carson Daly).[32] In his second single, ""The Way I Am"", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top ""My Name Is"". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for ""My Name Is"", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in ""The Way I Am"", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem.[33] In the third single, ""Stan"" (which samples Dido's ""Thank You"") Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring ""'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" from The Slim Shady LP).[16] Q magazine called ""Stan"" the third-greatest rap song of all time,[34] and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey.[35] The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone magazine's ""500 Greatest Songs of All Time"" list.[36] In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source magazine.[22] The Marshall Mathers LP has been certified 10× platinum by the RIAA.","Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001,[37] with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem's lyrics homophobic) condemning John's decision to perform with Eminem.[38] Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade ""best-of"" list: ""It was the hug heard 'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of ""Stan"" that would have been memorable in any context.""[39] On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony's venue).[40] In 2001 Eminem appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube[41] and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit,[42] headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit.","The Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week.[25] The album's single, ""Without Me"", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show (certified 10× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America) examines the effects of the rapper's rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip-hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP.[43] L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show's extensive use of obscenity and called the rapper ""Eminef"" for the prevalence of the word ""motherfucker"" on the album.[44] The Eminem Show was the best-selling album of 2002.[45]","On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was ""looking into"" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States.[46] The cause for concern was the lyrics of ""We As Americans"" (""Fuck money / I don't rap for dead presidents / I'd rather see the president dead / It's never been said, but I set precedents""), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore.[47]","Encore, released in 2004, was another success. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, ""Just Lose It"", which contained slurs about Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of ""Just Lose It"", Jackson phoned the Los Angeles-based Steve Harvey radio show to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson's hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song Eminem says, ""That's not a stab at Michael / That's just a metaphor / I'm just psycho"". Many of Jackson's friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder (who described it as ""kicking a man while he's down"" and ""bullshit"")[48] and Steve Harvey (who said, ""Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back"").[48] The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period.[49] ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song ""Lose Yourself"" on ""Couch Potato"" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson's protest: ""Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me.""[50] Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond ""Benzino"" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson.[51] In 2007 Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others.[52]","Despite its lead single's humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song ""Mosh"". The song criticized President George W. Bush as ""This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president"", with lyrics including ""Fuck Bush"".[53] On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 US Presidential election, Eminem released the video for ""Mosh"" on the Internet.[54] In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with ""VOTE Tuesday November 2"". After Bush's reelection, the video's ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president.[55]","In 2005, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering ending his rapping career after six years and several Multi-Platinum albums. Rumors began early in the year about a double album to be released late that year, entitled The Funeral;[56] the greatest hits album, entitled Curtain Call: The Hits, was released in December. In July the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. The day of Curtain Call: The Hits's release, Eminem appeared on WKQI's ""Mojo in the Morning"" show. Denying that he was retiring, he suggested he would take a break as an artist: ""I'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don't know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it 'Curtain Call', because this could be the final thing. We don't know.""[57] The following year, Eminem released Eminem Presents: The Re-Up on Shady Records.","In 2005, the rapper was ranked 58th in Bernard Goldberg's book, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America.[58] Goldberg cited a 2001 column by Bob Herbert of The New York Times, in which Herbert wrote ""In Eminem's world, all women are whores and he is eager to rape and murder them"",[59] and the song ""No One's Iller"" from the Slim Shady EP as examples of the rapper's misogyny.[60] That summer Eminem began his first US concert tour in three years, with the Anger Management 3 Tour featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and The Alchemist. In August he canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a ""dependency on sleep medication"".[61] Curtain Call: The Hits was released December 6, 2005 by Aftermath Entertainment.[62] During its first week it sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US, and was Eminem's fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200.[63] The album has been certified double platinum by the RIAA.[64]","In September 2007, Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was ""in limbo"" and ""debating"" about when (or if) he would release another album: ""I'm always working – I'm always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn't want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I'm coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.""[65]","Eminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: ""Right now I'm kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get 'cause I just start knowing stuff.""[66] Interscope confirmed that a new album[67] would be released in spring 2009.[68] In December 2008, the rapper provided a few more details about the album, entitled Relapse: ""Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on 'Relapse'. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let's just leave it at that.""[69]","According to a March 5, 2009 press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, ""We Made You"", had been released on April 7.[70] Although Relapse did not sell as well as the rapper's previous albums, it was a commercial success which received positive reviews and re-established his presence in the hip-hop world. Relapse was named one of the top albums of 2009, and has sold more than five million copies worldwide. During the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, Sacha Baron Cohen descended on the audience in an angel costume. He landed buttocks-first on Eminem, who stormed out of the ceremony; three days later, the rapper said that the stunt had been staged.[71] On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year.[72] Eminem's act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including ""Forever"" and ""Taking My Ball"". Eminem described the CD:","I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard.[73]","On April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: ""There is no Relapse 2"". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting ""RECOVERY"" with a link to his website. According to the rapper:","I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.[74]","His seventh album was released on June 18.[74] In the US Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart.[75][76] Eminem's sixth consecutive US number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total.[77][78]","Billboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums.[79] Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history.[80] Its first single, ""Not Afraid"", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4.[81] ""Not Afraid"" was followed by ""Love the Way You Lie"", which debuted at number two before rising to the top.[82] Although ""Love the Way You Lie"" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969).[83] Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21, 2010[update], the album had US sales of three million copies.[84] Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002's bestseller The Eminem Show to give the rapper two worldwide year-end number-one albums.[85][86] With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive US number-one albums by a solo artist.[87]","He appeared at the 2010 BET Awards,[88] performing ""Not Afraid"" and ""Airplanes, Part II"" with B.o.B and Keyshia Cole. Later that year, he performed at the Activison E3 concert. In June Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York, at concerts called The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts quickly sold out, prompting an additional show in each city.[89] BET called Eminem the number-one rapper of the 21st century.[90] He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing ""Not Afraid"" and ""Love the Way You Lie"" with Rihanna singing the choruses.[91] Due to the success of Recovery and the Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV[92] and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX.[93] He and Rihanna again collaborated on ""Love the Way You Lie (Part II)"", the sequel of their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective.[94] In December 2010, the ""Great Eminem Recovery"" was number one on Billboard's Top 25 Music Moments of 2010.[95] He appeared at the 2011 Grammy Awards on February 13, performing ""Love the Way You Lie (Part II)"" with Rihanna and Adam Levine and ""I Need a Doctor"" with Dr. Dre and Skylar Grey.[96] That month it was announced that ""Space Bound"" would be the fourth single from Recovery, with a music video featuring former porn star Sasha Grey;[97][98] the video was released June 24 on the iTunes Store.[99]","In 2010, Eminem again began collaborating with Royce da 5'9"" on their first EP as Bad Meets Evil; the duo formed in 1999. The EP, Hell: The Sequel, was released on June 14, 2011.[100] Eminem was featured on Royce da 5'9""'s ""Writer's Block"", released on April 8, 2011.[101] On May 3 they released the lead single ""Fast Lane"" from their upcoming EP, and a music video was filmed.[102] In March 2011, within days of each other, The Eminem Show and The Marshall Mathers LP were certified diamond by the RIAA; Eminem is the only rapper with two diamond-certified albums.[103] With more than 60 million ""likes"" he was the most-followed person on Facebook, outscoring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Michael Jackson.[104] Eminem was the first artist in five years with two number-one albums (Recovery and Hell: The Sequel) in a 12-month period.[105] Early in 2011 he leaked ""2.0 Boys"", on which Yelawolf and Slaughterhouse collaborated when they signed with Shady Records in January, and performed it in April.[106] Bad Meets Evil released their next single, ""Lighters"", on July 6 and its music video in late August.[107][108] On August 6, Eminem performed several songs from throughout his career at Lollapalooza with the artists who had been featured on each song.[109]","Eminem announced on May 24, 2012 that he was working on his next album,[110] scheduled for release the following year.[111] Without a title or release date, it was included on a number of ""Most Anticipated Albums of 2013"" lists (including MTV); Complex Magazine ranked it sixth, and XXL listed it fifth.[112]","Eminem talked about the album on June 30, 2012, with DJ Whoo Kid on Shade 45; the material was taking shape, and Dr. Dre would be involved.[113] On August 30, Slaughterhouse member Royce da 5'9"" said about it: ""I'm not so sure how the world is going to respond from some of the things that I've heard from him.""[114] Friend and fellow rapper 50 Cent was confirmed as appearing on the album.[115] Around this time, Eminem appeared on Pink's ""Here Comes The Weekend"", from The Truth About Love.","On February 11, 2013, Shady Records president and Eminem manager Paul Rosenberg announced that the rapper's eighth album would be released after Memorial Day.

""It's safe to say that it will be post-Memorial Day at some point, but we're not exactly sure when. We've got some dates locked in for him to perform live in Europe in August, so we're trying to see what else lines up."" The album remained untitled.[116] On March 22, Dr. Dre said that he worked with Eminem on the album and it was nearly finished;[117] No I.D. was confirmed as producer.[114]","On August 14 ""Survival"", featuring Liz Rodrigues and produced by DJ Khalil, premièred in the multi-player trailer for the video game Call of Duty: Ghosts.

In the episode Eminem sang snippets of Bob Seger songs at Colbert's prompting and briefly discussed Southpaw.[147]","In June 2015, it was revealed that he will serve as the executive producer and music supervisor on the TV series Motor City whose premise will be based upon the 2002 film Narc.[148] In June 2016, Eminem's ""Without Me"" from The Eminem Show appeared on the soundtrack of the film Suicide Squad.[149] In September 2016, Eminem was featured on Skylar Grey's song, ""Kill For You"", which appears on her album, Natural Causes.[150]","On October 19, 2016, Eminem released a new song called ""Campaign Speech"", a political hip hop song, and announced he was working on a new album.[151] On November 17, 2016, Eminem released a remastered version of 'Infinite' on his YouTube VEVO channel.[152] On November 22, 2016, Eminem released a trailer for a 10-minute short documentary called Partners in Rhyme: The True Story of Infinite[153]","In February 2017, Eminem appeared on ""No Favors"", a track from Big Sean's album I Decided. In the song, Eminem calls the newly elected President Donald Trump a ""bitch"", and also raps about raping conservative social and political commentator Ann Coulter, who is a Trump supporter. Coulter responded to the lyrics, stating, ""I think it's unfortunate that the left, from Berkeley to Eminem with his rap songs, has normalized violence against women, as Eminem has done.""[154]","After Eminem's Multi-Platinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; the rapper and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12, and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem's former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem's tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater, and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records.[13]","On December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater.[155] While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for ""Detroit Twelve"" or ""Dirty Dozen"", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan.[156] In 2001 D12's debut album, Devil's Night, was released.[157] The first single from the album was ""Shit on You"", followed by ""Purple Pills"" (an ode to recreational drug use) and ""Fight Music"". ""Purple Pills"" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song's references to drugs and sex, and renamed ""Purple Hills"".","After their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit singles ""My Band"" and ""How Come"". "" American pshyco 2"" featuring Cypress Hill member, B-Real, was another popular hit.[157] According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because ""he's busy doing his thing"".[158]","In January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.[159]","After small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for Got the Life (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the quasi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. According to the rapper, it is a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including ""Lose Yourself"" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running #1 hip hop single in history).[160] Eminem was absent from the ceremony, and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.[161]","The rapper has voiced the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof (as an aging, corrupt, Ebonics-speaking police officer) and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show (currently available on DVD).[162] He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel,[163] and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper.[164] Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People.","He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale ""Lose Yourself"" with Christina Aguilera.[165] Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit.[166] The rapper had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film, The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as homosexual.[167]","Eminem's autobiography, The Way I Am, was published October 21, 2008. Detailing his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak and depression, it includes stories of his rise to fame, commentary about past controversies and original lyric sheets from ""Stan"" and ""The Real Slim Shady"".[168] An autobiography of the rapper's mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.","Eminem appeared in two commercials which were shown during Super Bowl XLV. In the first, a one-minute spot for Lipton's Brisk iced tea, the rapper is a claymation figure.[169] In the second, a two-minute ad – the longest in Super Bowl history at the time – for the Chrysler 200, Eminem drives through Detroit (with ""Lose Yourself"" as the soundtrack) to his show at the Fox Theatre.[170][171]","He established the Marshall Mathers Foundation to aid disadvantaged youth. The foundation works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a Detroit attorney.[172]","Eminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham,[173] Kool G Rap,[174] Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane,[174] Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on ""The Message""), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run–D.M.C., Rakim and Boogie Down Productions.[175] In How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: ""Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats"".[176] In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique; varied, humorous subject matter,[177] connecting with his audience,[178] carrying a concept over a series of albums,[179] complex rhyme schemes,[180] bending words so they rhyme,[181] multisyllabic rhymes,[174] many rhymes to a bar,[182] complex rhythms,[183] clear enunciation[184] and the use of melody[185] and syncopation.[186] Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics,[187] being a ""workaholic""[188] and ""stacking"" vocals.[189]","Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. His best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the Slim Shady EP. In this persona his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist.[190] Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album's theme.[191] Another character is Ken Kaniff, a homosexual who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on the Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on Marshall Mathers and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, created a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing the rapper.[citation needed]","Although Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of Busta Rhymes' ""Touch It"" remix at the June 27, 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on Akon's single ""Smack That"" from Konvicted, Lil Wayne's hit ""Drop the World"", and ""My Life"" (the lead single from 50 Cent's Street King Immortal).","Eminem was the executive producer of D12's first two albums (Devil's Night and D12 World), Obie Trice's Cheers and Second Round's on Me and 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Massacre.[192] He has produced songs for other rappers, such as Jadakiss' ""Welcome To D-Block"", Jay-Z's ""Renegade"" and ""Moment of Clarity"", Lloyd Banks' ""On Fire"", ""Warrior Part 2"" and ""Hands Up"", Tony Yayo's ""Drama Setter"", Trick-Trick's ""Welcome 2 Detroit"", and Xzibit's ""My Name"" and ""Don't Approach Me"".[193] Most of The Eminem Show was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, Jeff Bass,[194] and the rapper co-produced Encore with Dr. Dre. In 2004 Eminem was co-executive producer of 2Pac's posthumous album Loyal to the Game with Shakur's mother, Afeni.[195] He produced the UK number-one single ""Ghetto Gospel"", featuring Elton John,[196] ""The Cross"" from the Nas album God's Son[197] and eight tracks on Obie Trice's 2006 Second Round's on Me (also appearing on ""There They Go"").[198] The rapper produced several tracks on Trick-Trick's The Villain (appearing on ""Who Want It""),[199] and produced four tracks on Cashis' 2013 album The County Hound 2.","Eminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats.[200] One exception was ""Stan"", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King.[200] After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, ""Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don't know what's in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch.""[201]","As a lyricist and a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared to Bob Dylan.[202] Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem, and Roth devoted a song on his album (""As I Em"") to him.[203] The accomplished trumpet player Nicholas Payton has called Eminem ""the Bix Beiderbecke of hip hop"".[204]","Eminem and Christian hip hop artist KJ-52 have been compared to each other, with KJ-52 called his ""Christian counterpart"".[205] KJ-52's single, ""Dear Slim"", was controversial with Eminem fans when it appeared on Total Request Live. Although he said the song was not intended to be disrespectful,[206] KJ-52 received hate mail and the song was number 26 on VH1's Top 40 Worst Moments in Hip Hop list.[207]","Eminem has been scrutinized, as a rapper and personally.[31] The rapper was married twice to Kimberly Anne ""Kim"" Scott. He met Kim in high school; he was 15 and she was 13 when he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J's ""I'm Bad"".[208] Kim and her twin sister Dawn had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15, and he began an on-and-off relationship with Kim in 1989. Their daughter Hailie was born on December 25, 1995; they married in 1999, divorcing in 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, ""I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again"", he and Kim briefly remarried in January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April,[209] agreeing to joint custody of Hailie.[210] He also has custody of Dawn's daughter Alaina[211] and Whitney, Kim's daughter from another relationship.[212][213] In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Kim had reconciled.[214] He had legal custody of his younger half-brother Nathan, who is a rapper known by his stage name ""Nate Kane"".[215][216] In his 2014 song ""Headlights"", Eminem apologized to, and reiterated his love for, his mother.[217]","In 1999, Eminem's mother sued him for about $10 million for slandering her on The Slim Shady LP, receiving about $1,600 in damages in 2001.[218] On June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when he pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerrera in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw him kissing his wife.[219][220] Eminem recreated the Guerrera assault in ""The Kiss (Skit)"" on The Eminem Show. The rapper was charged for a possession of a concealed weapon and assault, pleaded guilty and received two years' probation; Guerrera's assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement.[221] On July 7, 2000, Kim attempted suicide, slashing her wrists,[222] and later sued Eminem for defamation after he described her violent death in ""Kim"".[220]","On October 26, 2000, the rapper was scheduled to perform at Toronto's SkyDome when Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty said that Eminem should not be allowed to enter the country. ""I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women"", he said. Flaherty said he was ""disgusted"" when he read the lyrics of ""Kill You"", which includes the lines ""Slut, you think I won't choke no whore / Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?"" Although public reaction to Flaherty's position was generally negative, with barring Eminem from the country considered a free-speech issue, Liberal MPP Michael Bryant suggested that hate crime charges be brought against the rapper for advocating violence against women in his lyrics.[223] Robert Everett-Green wrote in a Globe and Mail editorial, ""Being offensive is Eminem's job description"",[224] and the rapper's Toronto concert went on as planned.[225]","Sanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing him in a false light in ""Brain Damage"", a song which portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely ""bumped"" him and gave him a ""little shove"". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; Judge Deborah Servitto, who rapped the verdict, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated.[226]","On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year's probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records.[227]","On March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for ""Kill You"" was from his instrumental ""Pulsion"".[228] Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted, and any remaining copies destroyed. A trial date was set for June 2004, and the case was later settled.[229]","On December 8, 2003 the United States Secret Service reported that it was ""looking into"" allegations that Eminem threatened President George W. Bush[230] in ""We As Americans"" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: ""Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said but I set precedents."" The incident was included in the video for ""Mosh"", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. ""We As Americans"" eventually appeared on Encore's deluxe-edition bonus disc, with altered lyrics.","In 2007, Eminem's music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple's iTunes.[231][232] The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009.[233]","In July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath's net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case.[234]","In October 2013, Eminem sampled Chicago-based rap group Hotstylz's 2008 viral hit, ""Lookin' Boy"", for his 2013 hit single, ""Rap God"". The group claims that Eminem did not receive permission to use the sample, nor did he credit or compensate them.[235] In November 2013, Hotstylz released a diss track towards Eminem titled ""Rap Fraud"", where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them.[236][237] In January 2015, TMZ reported that Hotstylz was suing the rapper and his label, Shady Records, for the amount of $8 million, for using the 26 second sample of ""Lookin' Boy"" on his song ""Rap God"", without their permission.[238][239]","Eminem has spoken about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium.[240] According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first ""sobered up"" in 2002.[241] During the production of 8 Mile, the rapper, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which ""knocked [him] out"", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would ""just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills"". Eminem began taking the drugs to ""feel normal"", taking a ""ridiculous amount [...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30"". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. The rapper's weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg), and he was regularly eating fast food: ""The kids behind the counter knew me – it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad"". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was he: ""Eminem ain't fat.""[14]","In December 2007, he was hospitalized after a methadone overdose. Eminem had first bought methadone from a dealer who had told him it was ""just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver"". The rapper continued to buy more, until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was ""about two hours from dying"". After missing Christmas with his children, Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use ""ramped right back to where it was before"" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him.[14]","Some of Eminem's lyrics have been considered homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country.[242] Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as ""faggot"" and ""queer"" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:[243]","The rapper is a friend of Elton John.[244] When The New York Times asked him of the legalization of same-sex marriage in Michigan, Eminem replied: ""I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want"",[245] adding that his ""overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be"".[246]","Several years later, Eminem was accused yet again of using homophobic words in his lyrics, and explained ""I don't know how to say this without saying it how I've said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin' or whatever, I never really equated those words...""[247]","In the book My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem, his mother stated that he has struggled with bipolar disorder throughout his life. She said it worsened after his ex-wife Kim Mathers gave birth to their daughter Hailie.[248]","Eminem is considered one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.

I kind of wanted a strict household.""[18] Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to LaGuardia High School in Manhattan, which focuses on visual and performing arts.[3] After graduation, Minaj wanted to become an actress, and she was cast in the Off-Broadway play In Case You Forget in 2001.[19] At the age of 19, as she struggled with her acting career, she worked as a waitress at Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers.[20] She said she was fired from ""at least fifteen jobs"" for similar reasons.[21] She also worked as an administrative assistant, in customer service and as an office manager for a Wall Street business.[22]","Minaj briefly signed with Brooklyn group Full Force, in which she rapped in a quartet called ""The Hoodstars"" composed of Lou$tar (son of ""Bowlegged Lou""), Safaree Samuels (Scaff Beezy) and 7even Up.[23][24] In 2004 the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, ""Don't Mess With"", which was featured on the compilation album ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol.6. 7even Up explained that he and Nicki weren't fans of Safaree's reggae edge that he brought to the group, and he even went so far to say that it was the reason they weren't getting signed by labels. Minaj later left Full Force and uploaded songs on her Myspace profile, sending several of her songs to people in the music industry. At the time, she was managed by Debra Antney. Fendi, CEO of Brooklyn label Dirty Money Entertainment, signed Minaj to his label in 2007 under a 180-day contract.[25] Originally adopting the stage name ""Nicki Maraj"", she changed it to Nicki Minaj stating that ""My real name is Maraj. Fendi flipped it when he met me because I had such a nasty flow! I eat bitches!""[26]","Minaj released her first mixtape, Playtime is Over, on Dirty Money Records on July 5, 2007[27] and her second, Sucka Free, on April 12, 2008.[28] That year, she was named Female Artist of the Year at the 2008 Underground Music Awards.[29] In 2009 Minaj was involved in a conflict with ego trip's Miss Rap Supreme winner Rece Steele, who was annoyed when Minaj interrupted her interview and put a sign behind Steele's head;[30] Minaj hung up on interviewers from Spate magazine when they asked about the incident.[31] She released her third mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty, on April 18, 2009[32] and it received favorable coverage on BET and MTV.[33][34] One of its tracks, ""I Get Crazy"", reached number 20 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart and number 37 on the magazine's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[35]","After Minaj was discovered by fellow rapper Lil Wayne,[36] in August 2009 it was reported that she signed a recording contract with his Young Money Entertainment.[37] That November, she appeared with Gucci Mane and Trina on the remix of ""5 Star Bitch"" by Yo Gotti.[38] Minaj also appeared on ""BedRock"" and ""Roger That""[39] on the compilation album, We Are Young Money (2009).[40] The singles peaked at numbers two and 56, respectively, on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100;[41] their parent album reached number-nine on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[41][42] Minaj was featured on Mariah Carey's ""Up Out My Face"", which reached number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100.[43] At Jay-Z's suggestion, that February Robin Thicke featured Minaj on ""Shakin' It 4 Daddy"".[44]","Minaj released the intended lead single from her upcoming debut album, ""Massive Attack"" on March 29, 2010.[45] Plans for the single were scrapped after an underwhelming commercial performance.[46] As a result, ""Your Love"" was released as the album's lead single on June 1,[47] peaking at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number-one on the Billboard Rap Songs chart.[35] In August, Minaj announced that the album would be entitled Pink Friday, a play on ""Black Friday"".[48] The following month she released ""Check It Out"" and ""Right Thru Me"" as follow-up singles.[49][50] In October, Minaj became the first female solo artist to have seven songs on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously and the first woman to appear on MTV's Annual Hottest MC List.[51][52]","Pink Friday was released on November 19,[53] debuting at number-two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 375,000 copies.[54] ""Moment 4 Life"" was released as the fourth single shortly after.[55] The album was certified platinum in December, and eventually reached number-one in the United States in February 2011.[56] Minaj performed ""Right Thru Me"" and ""Moment 4 Life"" as the musical guest on the January 29 episode of Saturday Night Live.[57] ""Super Bass"", the album's fifth single, was released in April 2011.[58] The song peaked at number-three on the Billboard Hot 100 and had been certified octuple-platinum in the U.S.[35][59] Minaj credited the song's initial exposure to its mention by Taylor Swift,[60] after videos of Swift and Selena Gomez rapping along to the song went viral, paving the way for Minaj's first big crossover pop moment.[61]","Minaj was one of the opening acts on Britney Spears' June 16 – August 13 Femme Fatale Tour.[62] She and Kesha appeared on the remix of Spears' ""Till the World Ends"", which peaked at number-three on the Billboard Hot 100.[63] On August 7, 2011, Nicki experienced a ""nip slip"" during a live performance on Good Morning America. Minaj was criticized for wearing the low-cut shirt during her performance which led to the brief exposure of her breast on a live telecast. ABC apologized for incident.[64] Minaj, while interviewed on ABC's Nightline show, apologized for the incident and denied that she intentionally sought to expose herself on live television as a publicity stunt.[65] The incident soaked protest from the Parents Television Council. President of the PTC president Tim Winter stated, ""the Parents Television Council has something to say about Nicki Minaj’s wardrobe malfunction this morning. For the umpteenth time in recent memory a morning news show has included inappropriate content for children and families."" Winter called out Good Morning America for not using the five-second delay to prevent the broadcast of the exposure.[66] Minaj has been invited to perform at fashion events; Donatella Versace invited her to perform with Prince for the introduction of a Versace collection for H&M, and she performed ""Super Bass"" at the 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.[67]","Since her breakout with Pink Friday, Minaj has been involved in a feud with rapper Lil' Kim, who accused Minaj of copying her style.[68] Although Minaj's ""Roman's Revenge"" was thought to be directed at Kim,[69] she said she was ""talking about everyone who has been in interviews talking ... no one is worth being singled out. No one is worth having their name mentioned out of my mouth and they never will get that.""[70] Kim escalated the feud with her mixtape, Black Friday (2011), whose title and artwork mimic Pink Friday;[68] a fragment from Minaj's diss track, ""Tragedy"", previewed that April.[71] Their conflict sparked a feud between Minaj and rapper Foxy Brown, who said Minaj misrepresented their conversation about Kim.[72] Brown released the diss tracks ""Hold Yuh"" and ""Massacre"" (directed at Kim and Minaj) in November 2010 and January 2011, respectively,[73][74] but Brown and Minaj settled their dispute in June 2012.[75]","Minaj released her second studio album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded in April 2012. The album was preceded by the promotional singles ""Roman in Moscow"" and ""Stupid Hoe"".[76][77] Critics suggested that the latter song was directed at Lil' Kim, who said: ""If you have to make a song called 'Stupid Hoe,' you must be a stupid hoe.""[78] Minaj and rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform their single, ""Give Me All Your Luvin'"", on the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012.[79] She was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, premiering ""Roman Holiday"" during the 2012 ceremony on February 12.[80] Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League criticizing Minaj for bringing a fake ""Pope"" to escort her on the red carpet. The ""exorcism"" scene that was performed during her appearance was criticized as well.[81][82] According to the Catholic League president Bill Donohue ""Perhaps the most vulgar part was the sexual statement that showed a scantily clad female dancer stretching backwards while an altar boy knelt between her legs in prayer. Finally, 'Come All Ye Faithful' was sung while a man posing as a bishop walked on stage; Minaj was shown levitating.""[82][83]","""Starships"" was released in February 2012 as the lead single from Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded.[84] The song reached number-five on the Billboard Hot 100,[35] and was the fifth best-selling single of 2012.[85] For the most part, mainstream critics didn't receive well the pop crossover move.[2] Minaj was sued by Chicago artist Clive Tanaka in September 2013 for its alleged copyright infringement.[86] Follow-up singles ""Beez in the Trap"" and ""Right by My Side"" were released shortly after.[87][88] Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded was released on April 2, two months later than planned.[89]","The album debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 253,000 copies,[54] and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in June 2012.[90] However, its mix of hip-hop songs and mainstream pop material received mixed reviews from music critics.[91] ""Pound the Alarm"" and ""Va Va Voom"" were released as the final singles from the album.[92][93] Minaj began her headlining Pink Friday Tour on May 16, 2012,[94] which was followed by the Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour beginning October 14.[95] Although she was scheduled to headline the June 3 Hot 97 Summer Jam at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, at the request of Lil Wayne she canceled her appearance the day of the show after Peter Rosenberg of the station called ""Starships"" not ""real hip-hop"".[96]","The following month, Minaj voiced Steffie in the animated film Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012).[97] She won awards for Best Female Video (for ""Starships"") at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and Best Hip-Hop at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards.[98] Her collaboration with Pearl Future on the song ""Looking At Me"" made it to the top 20 in BBC Radio 1.[99] An expanded version of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, subtitled The Re-Up, was released on November 19.[100] That month, Minaj was the subject of a three-part E! documentary titled Nicki Minaj: My Truth.[101] She announced plans for her own record label after signing Parker Ighile, Brinx, Keisha and Blackout Movement.[102]","In September, Minaj joined the judges' panel for the twelfth season of American Idol with fellow new judges Mariah Carey and Keith Urban and the returning Randy Jackson.[103] That October a leaked video circulated, with Minaj and Carey in a heated argument during auditions in Charlotte, North Carolina.[104] Carey accused Minaj of saying, ""If I had a gun, I would shoot that bitch"", but Minaj denied the allegation.[105] Carey said that Minaj created an ""unsafe work environment"", increasing her security as a result.[106]","Tensions escalated after Carey said that Minaj did not have a number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 during a live broadcast in May 2013, to which Minaj responded in a series of ""extremely harsh"" tweets directed at the singer.[107] Minaj and Carey left the series that month, at the end of the season.[108] That year Minaj was the most-charted female rapper in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, with 44 entries, tying Mariah Carey.[109] Her seven nominations led those for rap musicians at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards,[110] and she was the first rapper to win the BET Best Female Hip-Hop Artist Award four consecutive times.[111]","Minaj's first live-action theatrical film The Other Woman was filmed in spring 2013 and premiered on April 25, 2014.[112] She played Lydia, assistant to Carly (played by Cameron Diaz).[113][114] In 2013, Minaj described her then-forthcoming third album, The Pinkprint as ""a continuation of The Re-Up with a lot more"" and said it would focus on her ""hip-hop roots"".[115][116] During an MTV interview, she said that her third album would be ""next level"" and have ""much to talk about"": ""I'm really excited and the people that have been working with me now, have been people that I haven't worked with before so it's like they're bringing a new sound to the album that I've never experimented with.""[117] ""Pills n Potions"" was released as the lead single from The Pinkprint in May 2014.[118] ""Anaconda"" was released in August as the second single, peaking at number-two on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her highest-charting single in the U.S. to date.[119][120] The video set a 24-hour Vevo record, accumulating 19.6 million views on its first day of release, breaking the record previously held by Miley Cyrus for ""Wrecking Ball"".[121] The album was officially released on December 15, 2014, peaking at number-two on the Billboard 200 chart.","On June 29, Minaj became the only artist to win the BET Award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist for five consecutive years, while also tying Missy Elliott for the most wins with five.[122] In November 2014, Minaj released a video containing Nazi-style imagery for her third single ""Only"". There was immediate backlash from the Anti Defamation League, who stated that it was ""troubling that no one among Minaj's group of producers, publicists and managers raised a red flag about the use of such imagery before ushering the video into public release."" They called the video ""insensitive to Holocaust survivors and a trivialization of the history of that era.""[123][124]","On November 9, 2014, Minaj hosted the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards at The SSE Hydro, Glasgow, Scotland.

In ""Moment 4 Life"", she refers to herself as a ""king"" rather than a queen.[138] Early in her career Minaj claimed to be bisexual, but eventually she said she just did that to get attention. ""I think girls are sexy, but I'm not going to lie and say that I date girls.""[139]","Minaj has been called the ""black Lady Gaga"" because of her costumes and wigs. In one interview, Minaj rejected the comparison,[140] but in another interview, she said that she is inspired by Gaga's creativity.[141] Minaj has cited Alexander McQueen, Gianni Versace and Christian Louboutin as her favorite designers.[142] The Huffington Post described her style as ""risk-taking"" and ""far-out"", with ""bold sartorial choices"";[143] Yahoo! called her dress ""colorful"" and ""crazy"", and ""the fashion and music world would certainly be very quiet without Ms Minaj"".[144]","Billboard listed Minaj the fourth-most-active musician on social media on its March 2011 Social 50 chart.[145] On Twitter, she is the world's most-followed rapper, with over 20 million followers on the app.[146] On Twitter, in public appearances and in interviews, Minaj calls her fans ""Barbz"" (alluding to her Barbie persona).[147]","In 2013, Minaj introduced a more ""natural"" look, including less-colorful makeup and wigs, during later episodes of American Idol to be taken more seriously.[148][149]","When I started rapping, people were trying to make me like the typical New York rapper, but I'm not that. No disrespect to New York rappers, but I don't want people to hear me and know exactly where I'm from.","Minaj is known for her animated rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which has been compared to her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj ""a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones.""[150] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: ""What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention.""[151]","Noted as a rap artist, she lends herself to electronic music genres[152] (especially electropop).

Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, ""[Minaj] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill [sic] vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions.""[162]","Minaj's ""Monster"" verse was listed by Complex as the best rap verse of the 2010s.[163] West claimed at one point he considered deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:","It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki’s verse off of “Monster” because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on “Dark Fantasy” and people to this day would say to me ‘My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj’s verse.’ So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment…[164]","With her parents frequently fighting during her childhood, Minaj lived through characters she created as a means of escape. She recalled that ""fantasy was my reality"" and her first identity was Cookie, who became Harajuku Barbie and (later) Nicki Minaj.[165] In November 2010, Minaj assumed the alter ego Nicki Teresa, wearing a colorful headdress and calling herself ""healer to her fans"" during a visit to the Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse Studios in New York.[166] She introduced another alter ego, Rosa (pronounced with an exaggerated R), to commemorate her December 2010 appearance on Lopez Tonight.[167]","For Pink Friday, Minaj created another alter ego: Roman Zolanski, ""a demon inside her"", Minaj's ""twin brother"" whose character she assumes when she is angry.[168] Roman has been compared to Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on ""Roman's Revenge"" Minaj and Eminem collaborate as their alter egos.[169] On her next album, she said that there would be a lot of Roman: ""And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot.""[170] Roman has a mother, Martha Zolanski,[171] who appeared on ""Roman's Revenge"" with a British accent[172] and singing on ""Roman Holiday"" for the first time.[173][174] Martha appeared in the ""Moment 4 Life"" video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother.

I was really interested in her mind and her aura [and] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time.""[185] She said: ""I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life, and you've gotta tell people that when they're alive to even be able to take the compliment, instead of paying tribute to them when they're no longer here"", adding that Foxy Brown was ""the most influential female rapper"" for her,[186] though she initially was compared to Lil Kim when she first debuted. Nicki and Lil Kim, often cited as Foxy's main rap rival, have reportedly exchanged words with each other, on social media and in their music.[187]","Jada Pinkett Smith is one of Minaj's role models in her acting career.[188] Minaj was inspired by R&B singer Monica, singing ""Why I Love You So Much"" at every talent show she entered. Performing in Atlanta on her Pink Friday Tour, she called Monica one of her all-time greatest musical influences.[189] Minaj has also cited Kanye West, Trina and Drake as influences.[190]","She called Betsey Johnson a fashion inspiration: ""[Betsey] is a free spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and considerate and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [I was] bowing down to her; she's dope!""[191] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: ""When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, you have to get your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting.

Three months after the release of Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne began work on her eponymously titled fifth studio album, which was released by Epic Records on 1 November 2013[16][17][18] following her departure from RCA Records in 2011.","Lavigne took a break from recording music, pursuing careers in feature film acting and designing clothes and perfumes. She voiced Heather, a Virginia opossum, in the animated film Over the Hedge in 2006. That same year, she made her on-screen feature film debut in Fast Food Nation. In 2008, Lavigne introduced her clothing line, Abbey Dawn, and in 2009 she released her first perfume, Black Star, which was followed by Forbidden Rose in 2010, and Wild Rose in 2011. In July 2006, Lavigne married her boyfriend of two years, Deryck Whibley, lead singer and guitarist for Sum 41. The marriage lasted four years. In October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce. Whibley and Lavigne continued to work together, with Whibley producing her fourth album, as well as Lavigne's single ""Alice"", written for Tim Burton's film Alice in Wonderland.",,,"Lavigne was born in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. Her mother is of English, Scottish, and German descent, and her father, Jean-Claude Joseph Lavigne, is of French-Canadian origin.[19] She was named ""Avril"" by her father[20] after the French word for the month of April. He and Lavigne's mother, Judy,[21] recognized their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang ""Jesus Loves Me"" on the way home from church.[22] Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle,[23] both of whom teased her when she sang. ""My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying.""[22]","When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to Greater Napanee, Ontario,[24] a town with a population of approximately 5,000.[25][26][27] In school, she was sometimes kicked out of class for misbehaving, her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio; following his own love for music Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Center in Kingston, Ontario, where he often played bass. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions.[28] Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks, and Shania Twain. She also began writing her own songs. Her first song was called ""Can't Stop Thinking About You"", about a teenage crush, which she described as ""cheesy cute"".[29]","In 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with the Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people.[30][24][25] Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, ""What Made You Say That"",[24] and Lavigne told Twain that she was going to be ""a famous singer"".[25] During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, ""Touch the Sky"", for his 1999 album, Quinte Spirit. She later sang on ""Temple of Life"" and ""Two Rivers"" for his follow-up album, My Window to You, in 2000.","In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Kingston, Ontario.[24][25] Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives.[31] Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, Nettwerk, received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement.[32] Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer Peter Zizzo during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song ""Why"". Lavigne was noticed by Arista Records during a trip to New York.[31]","In November 2000,[26] Ken Krongard, an A&R representative, invited Antonio ""L.A."" Reid, then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition ""so impressed"" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25 million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance.[27][24] By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed skateboarding, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career.[26][33][29] Lavigne's band was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the Canadian punk rock scene who would fit with Lavigne's personality.[34]","Reid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told HitQuarters that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with The Matrix production team—including ""Complicated"", later released as her debut single—that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording of Lavigne's debut album, Let Go, finished in January 2002.[35]","Lavigne released Let Go in June 2002 in the US, where it reached number two on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK—this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the UK Albums Chart at that time.[36] By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and Let Go the top-selling debut of the year.[37] By May 2003, Let Go had accumulated over 1,000,000 sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association.[38] By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide,[39] and the RIAA certified the album six-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units in the US (it has sold 6.8 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan[40]).[41]","Lavigne's debut single, ""Complicated"", peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the US.

Lavigne said that Under My Skin proved her credentials as a songwriter, saying that ""each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much[sic] emotions in those songs"".[55] ""Don't Tell Me"", the lead single off the album, reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia. ""My Happy Ending"", the album's second single, was a top five hit in the UK and Australia. In the US, it was a top ten entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a number-one pop radio hit.

Her concert on 29 August was thought that it would promote wrong values ahead of Malaysia's independence day on 31 August.[72] On 21 August 2008, MTV reported that the concert had been approved by the Malaysian government.[73]","In January 2010, Lavigne worked with Disney clothing designs inspired by Tim Burton's feature film Alice in Wonderland.

Lavigne is also reported to be going back to her roots for her new album, releasing it before the end of 2017, and was working on finalizing the final few tracks on the new album.[104]","Themes in Lavigne's music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view.[105] Lavigne believes her ""songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true.""[106] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as ""Losing Grip"", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as ""Complicated"", saying that ""the songs I did with the Matrix ... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore.""[107] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that ""I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about ... Like boys, like dating or relationships"".[108] Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style.[109][110][111][112] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. ""Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through.""[113] Her objective in writing the album was simply to ""make it fun"".[114] The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs.[115] Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records,[82] with Lavigne describing the album as ""more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional"".[116] Ian McKellen defined her as ""a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian"" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.[117][118]","""I know my fans look up to me and that's why I make my songs so personal; it's all about things I've experienced and things I like or hate. I write for myself and hope that my fans like what I have to say. – Avril Lavigne[106]","Most critics and publications, such as The New York Times, Rolling Stone, NME, MusicMight, IGN and PopMatters, have identified Lavigne as a mix of alternative rock, pop rock and pop punk,[119][120][121][122][123][124] influenced by a post-grunge sound.[125][126][127][119][128][129]","While Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. She said ""I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me"", adding that she had been writing ""full-structured songs"" since she was 14.[55] Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles ""Complicated"", ""Sk8er Boi"" and ""I'm with You"". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that ""[N]one of those songs aren't from me"".[107] In 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk, who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism[130] and criticized her songwriting, saying that ""Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything.""[131] Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for ""clear defamation"" against her character.[132] Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that ""Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her.""[130] Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band the Rubinoos, sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and Lukasz ""Dr. Luke"" Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of ""I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend"" for her song ""Girlfriend"".[133] Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, ""me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a Sum 41 song. It's the Sex Pistols, not the Rubinoos.""[132] In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.[134]","Lavigne's earlier influences came from country music acts such as Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain;[107][29] and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia and Janis Joplin.[108] By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk and punk rock acts such as blink-182, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Incubus and the Used; as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind and Matchbox Twenty.[135][136][137][138][139][140][141]","Because of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's personal style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, ""It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest"".[142] Lavigne also commented on the matter: ""I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel ... punk, and I am so not any of them.""[55] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: ""I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do.""[135][143]","In 2003, Lavigne won an International Achievement Award for the song ""Complicated"" at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto.[144]","Lavigne received eight Grammy Awards nominations in two years, including Best New Artist.

The album Let Go reached number one in its 18th chart week.[156] She also was the first to reach 100 million views on a YouTube video, with her 2007 single ""Girlfriend"".[157] Lavigne was the first western artist to do a full tour in China, with The Best Damn Tour in 2008; and is considered the biggest western artist in Asia, especially in Japan where her first three albums have sold more than 1 million copies, being the only Female Western Artist since 2000s to achieved it.[158] Avril Lavigne is the only artist to have perfomed on three different multi-sport event, such as two closing ceremonies of Winter Olympic Games (Torino 2006[159] and Vancouver 2010[160]) and in the opening ceremony of the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.[161]","The singer's influences extends beyond pop rock, pop punk and pop acts such as Aly & AJ,[162] Busted,[163] Hilary Duff,[164] Rob Halford (Judas Priest),[165] Charlotte Sometimes,[166] Ed Sheeran,[167] Miley Cyrus,[168] Vanessa Hudgens, Jessie J,[169] Jonas Brothers,[170] Brie Larson,[171] Danielle McKee, Lesley Roy,[172] Selena Gomez,[173] Ashley Tisdale,[174] Ariana Grande,[175] Paramore,[176] Amy Studt,[177] Meghan Trainor,[178] Miranda Cosgrove, Tonight Alive, Hey Monday, Kelly Osbourne, Liz Phair,[179] Amanda Palmer, Misono,[180] YUI,[181] Demi Lovato, PVRIS, among others.[182][183]","Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video ""Nobody's Home"" involved the most ""acting"".[106] Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,[184] performing ""Sk8er Boi""[185] with her band in a nightclub.[186] She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film Going the Distance. The main characters bump into her backstage at the MuchMusic Video Awards[187] after her performance of ""Losing Grip"".[188]","She moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to New Mexico[189] to film a single scene in the 2007 film, The Flock.[190] She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and Richard Gere. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.[190] On her role in The Flock, Lavigne said, ""I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast"".[106] The Flock was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7 million in the foreign box office.[191]","Lavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, ""All the actors went in individually, and [director] Tim and [screenwriter Karey] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.""[192] Lavigne found the recording process to be ""easy"" and ""natural"", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. ""I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still."" Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. ""[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude"".[106] The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38 million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336 million worldwide.[193]","In December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in Fast Food Nation, based on the book Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal.[194] The fictionalized adaptation, directed by Richard Linklater, traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.[195] Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.[196][197] The film opened on 17 November 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2 million worldwide.[198]","Both Over the Hedge and Fast Food Nation opened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the ""right parts and the right movies."" Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. ""I wanted to start off small and to learn [that] I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part.""[106] In August 2006, Canadian Business magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List.

It is produced by Kohl's, which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.[200][201] Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a ""juniors lifestyle brand"",[69] which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and ""hot pinks and blacks"". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. ""I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.""[202] The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, ""after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career"".[80]","The designs were also featured on the Internet game Stardoll, where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.[203] On 14 September 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the New York Fashion Week,[204] returning in 2011.[80] In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.[205][116] ""It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself.

""I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not.""[28] By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was ""wearing a costume"".[27] Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career.

He found no success in the sport film Awwal Number with Aditya Pancholi and Dev Anand, the mythological thriller Tum Mere Ho, the romance Deewana Mujh Sa Nahin and the social drama Jawani Zindabad.[42] However, the Indra Kumar-directed romantic drama Dil (opposite Madhuri Dixit) was a major success.[43] A tale of parental opposition to teenage love, Dil was highly popular among the youth,[42] and emerged as the highest-grossing Hindi film of the year.[44][45] He followed this success with a leading role alongside Pooja Bhatt in the romantic comedy Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin (1991), a remake of the Hollywood film It Happened One Night (1934), which proved to be a box office hit.[46]","Khan appeared in several other films in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992), Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke (1993) (for which he also wrote the screenplay), and Rangeela (1995). Most of these films were successful critically and commercially.[47][48][49] Other successes include Andaz Apna Apna, co-starring Salman Khan. At the time of its release, the movie was reviewed unfavorably by critics, but over the years has gained cult status.[50]","Khan continued to act in just one or two films a year, then an unusual trait for a mainstream Hindi cinema actor. His only release in 1996 was the Dharmesh Darshan-directed commercial blockbuster Raja Hindustani, in which he was paired opposite Karisma Kapoor. The film earned him his first Filmfare Best Actor Award, after seven previous nominations, and went on to become the biggest hit of the year, as well as the third-highest grossing Indian film of the 1990s.[51] Khan's career seemed to hit a plateau at this point of time, and most of the films to follow for the next few years were only partially successful. In 1997, he co-starred alongside Ajay Devgn, Kajol and Juhi Chawla in Ishq, which performed well at the box office. The following year, Khan appeared in the moderately successful Ghulam, for which he also did playback singing.[52] John Mathew Matthan's Sarfarosh, Khan's first release in 1999, was also moderately successful, gaining an above average box office verdict.[53] The film and Khan's role in it were highly appreciated by movie critics, as was his role in Deepa Mehta's art house film Earth.[54] His first release for the new millennium, Mela, in which he acted alongside his real-life brother Faisal Khan, was both a box-office and critical bomb.[55]","In 2001, he appeared in Lagaan. The film was a major critical and commercial success,[56] and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards. Additionally, the film gathered critical acclaim at several international film festivals, in addition to winning numerous Indian awards, including the National Film Awards. Khan himself won his second Filmfare Best Actor Award.[57]","The success of Lagaan was followed by Dil Chahta Hai later that year, in which Khan co-starred with Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna, with Preity Zinta playing his love interest.

The film was screened at the Cannes Film Festival.[61],"Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's award-winning Rang De Basanti was Khan's first release in 2006. His performance was critically acclaimed,[62] earning him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor and various nominations for Best Actor. The film went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of the year,[63] and was selected as India's official entry to the Oscars. Although the film was not shortlisted as a nominee for the Oscar, it received a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language at the BAFTA Awards in England. In his next movie, Fanaa (2006), Khan co-starred with Kajol.[64] The film became one of the highest-grossing Indian films of 2006.[63]","His 2007 film, Taare Zameen Par, was also produced by him and marked his directorial debut.[65] The film, which was the second offering from Aamir Khan Productions, starred Khan in a supporting role as a teacher who befriends and helps a dyslexic child. It opened to excellent responses from critics and audiences.

The film was a major commercial success[74] and became the highest-grossing Bollywood movie of that year. For his performance in the film, Khan received several Best Actor nominations at various award ceremonies as well as his fifteenth Filmfare Best Actor nomination.[75]","In 2009, Khan appeared in the commercially and critically acclaimed film 3 Idiots as Ranchodas Chanchad. 3 Idiots became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time in India,[76][77] breaking the previous record set by Ghajini, which also starred Khan. The film grossed ₹202 crore (US$31 million).[78] 3 Idiots was of the few Indian films to become a major success in East Asian markets such as China[79] and Japan,[80] eventually bringing its overseas total to US$25 million—the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time in overseas markets.[81][82] It was expected to be the first Indian film to be officially released on YouTube, within 12 weeks of releasing in theatres on 25 March 2010, but finally got officially released on YouTube in May 2012.[83] The film also won six Filmfare Awards (including best film and best director), ten Star Screen Awards, eight IIFA Awards[84] and three National Film Awards.[85]","It was reported that Khan had disagreements with director Reema Kagti over the issue of his 2012 film Talaash, causing significant delays in the film's release.[86] However, Khan said that the claims were baseless.[87] The film was a hit in India and overseas markets.[88]","Khan's next venture was Dhoom 3 with Yash Raj Films. He has considered this to be the most difficult role of his career.[89][90] The film was released worldwide on 20 December 2013.[91][92] Box Office India declared Dhoom 3 ""the biggest hit of 2013"" after two days of release,[93] with the film grossing ₹2 billion (US$31 million) worldwide in three days[94] and ₹4 billion (US$62 million) worldwide in ten days, making it the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time.[94][95][96]","In 2014, Khan appeared as the eponymous alien in Rajkumar Hirani's comedy-drama PK.

Raja Sen called the film a ""triumph"" and said: ""Aamir Khan is exceptional in PK, creating an irresistibly goofy character and playing him with absolute conviction.""[102]","In December 2016, Khan appeared as a wrestler in Nitesh Tiwari's Dangal,[103] which he also produced. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time domestically, surpassing PK, making it the fifth time Khan had achieved this feat.[104] Khan also won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[105]",Khan will be making a guest appearance in Secret Superstar.[106] Khan has also committed to starring in Thugs Of Hindostan with Amitabh Bachchan.

Its first film was Lagaan. The movie was released in 2001, starring Khan as the lead actor. The film was selected as India's official entry to the 74th Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, but it lost to No Man's Land. The film won numerous awards at several Indian award functions such as Filmfare and IIFA, and won the National Film Award for Most Popular Film, an award shared between Khan and the film's director, Ashutosh Gowariker.[108] Khan later commented on the loss of Lagaan at the Oscars: ""Certainly we were disappointed. But the thing that really kept us in our spirits was that the entire country was behind us"".","For producing the documentary Madness in the Desert on the making of Lagaan, Khan and director Satyajit Bhatkal were awarded the National Film Award for Best Exploration/Adventure Film at the 51st National Film Awards ceremony.[109]","In 2007 he produced the drama Taare Zameen Par, which marked his directorial debut.

The film was conceived of and developed by the husband and wife team of Amole Gupte and Deepa Bhatia. It is the story of a young child who suffers in school until a teacher identifies him as dyslexic. The movie was critically acclaimed,[110] as well as a box office success. Taare Zameen Par won the 2008 Filmfare Best Movie Award as well as a number of other Filmfare and Star Screen Awards. Khan's work also won him the Best Director. In 2008, Khan launched his nephew Imran Khan's debut in the film Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na under his production house. The film was a big hit in India, and earned Khan another nomination for Best Movie at the Filmfare.[111]","In 2011, Khan released his home production Dhobi Ghat,[112] which was directed by his wife Kiran Rao.

The show dealt with social issues. It started airing on 6 May 2012. Aamir was paid Rs. 30 million rupees per episode to host the Satyamev Jayate, and it made him the highest paid host in Indian television industry as of June 2012.[117] Aamir, speaking on a radio channel, said that in view of phenomenal public response, he may come up with a second season of the show.[118] The show went live simultaneously on Star Plus, STAR World and national broadcaster Doordarshan on the 11 am Sunday slot in eight languages, being the first to do so in India.[119]","Satyamev Jayate opened to positive reviews and feedback from social activists, media houses, doctors, and film and television personalities. Khan was also praised for his effort.[120] In her review, Ritu Singh of IBN Live stated, ""Aamir Khan deserves an applause for bringing up such a sensitive issue and presenting it in a hard hitting way. The amount of research Aamir and his team has put into the show was clearly visible with the facts and figures presented. Every aspect of the issue was covered with great diligence.""[121] Parmita Uniyal from Hindustan Times praised the content and Khan for ""step[ing] in to do what journalists are supposed to do – make a difference. The show is a classic example of that.""[122] Despite the initial hype and being labelled as the channel's most ambitious project till date, the initial viewership figures were not very encouraging; the show received an average television rating of 2.9 (with a reach of 14.4 million, it was watched by only 20% of TV viewers) in the six metros in its debut episode on 6 May.

I think every person should follow his/her dream and try and make it possible to create an ability to achieve it backed by its practicality."" He has also indicated that he is more interested in the process of filmmaking than in the end result: ""For me, the process is more important, more joyful. I would like to have my entire concentration on the process right from the first step.""","Khan has a reputation for avoiding award ceremonies and not accepting any popular Indian film awards. Though nominated many times, Khan has not attended any Indian film award ceremonies and has stated that ""Indian film awards lack credibility"".[127] When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian film awards, Aamir Khan said, ""Fact is that I have no objections to film awards per se. I just feel that if I don't value a particular film award, then I won't attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I don't see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I don't trust them. I have no faith in them so I would prefer to stay away.""[128][129][130]","In 2007, Khan was invited to have a wax imitation of himself put on display at Madame Tussauds in London.[131] Khan declined, saying, ""It's not important to me ... people will see my films if they want to.

He quoted to support adivasis (tribes), who might be displaced from their homes.[145] Later he faced protests and a partial ban on his film Fanaa, but the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, supported him by saying, ""Everyone has the freedom of expression. If someone says something on a particular subject, that doesn't mean you should start protesting.""[146] Aamir also lent his support to the Janlokpal Bill Movement led by Anna Hazare in August 2011.[147]","He has been supporting common causes; when asked about views on entertainment tax in 2012 budget, Khan said, ""I don't want any reduction in that, all I expect is focus on education and nutrition.""[148] He quit the GOI's copyrights panels in February 2010 after facing sharp differences with other members.[149] During the promotion of 3 Idiots, he journeyed to diverse parts of India, mostly to small towns, noting that ""film makers from Mumbai don't understand small town India.""[150] This experience of reaching out to ""regional India"" was extended in his debut TV show, Satyamev Jayate. On 16 July 2012, Khan met the prime minister and the minister for social justice and empowerment and discussed the plight of manual scavengers and sought eradication of manual scavenging in the country.[151]","On 30 November 2011, Khan was appointed national brand ambassador of UNICEF to promote child nutrition.[152] He is part of the government-organised IEC campaign to raise awareness about malnutrition.[153]","""I think in the last maybe six to eight months, there is a growing sense of despondency.

The_Economist,"The Economist is an English-language weekly magazine-format newspaper owned by the Economist Group and edited at offices in London.[2][6][7][8] Continuous publication began under its founder, James Wilson, in September 1843. In 2015 its average weekly circulation was a little over 1.5 million, about half of which were sold in the United States.[5][2]","The publication belongs to the Economist Group. It is 50% owned by the English branch of the Rothschild family and by the Agnelli family through its holding company Exor. The remaining 50% is held by private investors including the editors and staff.[9][10] The Rothschilds and the Agnellis are represented on the board of directors.[11] A board of trustees formally appoints the editor, who cannot be removed without its permission. Although The Economist has a global emphasis and scope, about two-thirds of the 75 staff journalists are based in the London borough of Westminster.[12] For the year to March 2016 the Economist Group declared operating profit of £61m.[13] Previous major shareholders include Pearson PLC.[14]","The Economist takes an editorial stance of classical and economic liberalism that supports free trade, globalisation, free immigration, and cultural liberalism (such as supporting legal recognition for same-sex marriage or drug liberalization).[2] The publication has described itself as ""...a product of the Caledonian liberalism of Adam Smith and David Hume"".[15] It targets highly educated readers and claims an audience containing many influential executives and policy-makers.[16] The publication's CEO described this recent global change, which was first noticed in the 1990s and accelerated in the beginning of the 21st century, as a ""new age of Mass Intelligence"".[17][18]",,,"On the contents page of each issue, The Economist's mission statement is written in italics. It states that The Economist was ""First published in September 1843 to take part in 'a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.'""[19]","The Economist was founded by the British businessman and banker James Wilson in 1843, to advance the repeal of the Corn Laws, a system of import tariffs.[20] A prospectus for the ""newspaper"" from 5 August 1843 enumerated thirteen areas of coverage that its editors wanted the publication to focus on:[21]","It has long been respected as ""one of the most competent and subtle Western periodicals on public affairs"".[22] The publication was a major source of financial and economic information for Karl Marx in the formulation of socialist theory; he wrote: ""the London Economist, the European organ of the aristocracy of finance, described most strikingly the attitude of this class.""[23]",Its logo was designed in 1959 by Reynolds Stone.[24],"In January 2012 The Economist launched a new weekly section devoted exclusively to China, the first new country section since the introduction of a section about the United States in 1942.[25]",In August 2015 The Economist Group bought back 5 million of its shares (worth $284 million) from Pearson. Pearson's remaining shares (worth $447 million) would be sold to Exor.[26][27],The editors of The Economist have been:,"When the news magazine was founded, the term ""economism"" denoted what would today be termed ""economic liberalism"". The Economist generally supports free trade, globalisation,[34] and free immigration. The activist and journalist George Monbiot has described it as neo-liberal while occasionally accepting the propositions of Keynesian economics where deemed more ""reasonable"".[35] The news magazine favours a carbon tax to fight global warming.[36] According to one former editor, Bill Emmott, ""the Economist's philosophy has always been liberal, not conservative"".[37] Individual contributors take diverse views. The Economist favours the support, through central banks, of banks and other important corporations. This principle can, in a much more limited form, be traced back to Walter Bagehot, the third editor of The Economist, who argued that the Bank of England should support major banks that got into difficulties. Karl Marx deemed The Economist the ""European organ"" of ""the aristocracy of finance"".[38]","The news magazine has also supported liberal causes on social issues such as recognition of gay marriages,[39] legalisation of drugs,[40] criticises the US tax model in a recent issue,[41] and seems to support some government regulation on health issues, such as smoking in public,[42] as well as bans on spanking children.[43] The Economist consistently favours guest worker programmes, parental choice of school, and amnesties[44] and once published an ""obituary"" of God.[45] The Economist also has a long record of supporting gun control.[46]","The Economist has endorsed both the Labour Party (in 2005) and the Conservative Party (in 2010 and 2015)[47][48] at general election time in Britain, and both Republican and Democratic candidates in the United States. Economist.com puts its stance this way:","What, besides free trade and free markets, does The Economist believe in? ""It is to the Radicals that The Economist still likes to think of itself as belonging. The extreme centre is the paper's historical position"". That is as true today as when Crowther [Geoffrey, Economist editor 1938–1956] said it in 1955. The Economist considers itself the enemy of privilege, pomposity and predictability. It has backed conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It has supported the Americans in Vietnam. But it has also endorsed Harold Wilson and Bill Clinton, and espoused a variety of liberal causes: opposing capital punishment from its earliest days, while favouring penal reform and decolonisation, as well as—more recently—gun control and gay marriage.[24]","The Economist frequently accuses figures and countries of corruption or dishonesty. In recent years, for example, it criticised Paul Wolfowitz, World Bank president; Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's Prime Minister (who dubbed it The Ecommunist);[49] Laurent-Désiré Kabila, the late president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Robert Mugabe, the head of government in Zimbabwe; and, recently, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina.[50] The Economist also called for Bill Clinton's impeachment and, after the emergence of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse,[51] for Donald Rumsfeld's resignation. Though The Economist initially gave vigorous support for the US-led invasion of Iraq, it later called the operation ""bungled from the start"" and criticised the ""almost criminal negligence"" of the Bush Administration's handling of the war, while maintaining, in 2007, that pulling out in the short term would be irresponsible.[52] In the 2004 US election, the editors ""reluctantly"" backed John Kerry.[53][54] In the 2008 US election The Economist endorsed Barack Obama, while using the front cover of the issue published on the eve of the election to promote his candidacy.[55] In the 2012 US election, Barack Obama was again endorsed: the editorial said that they preferred Obama on the economy, foreign policy and health care, but criticised him for running a negative campaign against Romney and for a ""...poor appreciation of commerce.""[56]","Though it has many individual columns, by tradition and current practice the magazine ensures a uniform voice—aided by the anonymity of writers—throughout its pages,[57] as if most articles were written by a single author, which may be perceived to display dry, understated wit, and precise use of language.[58][59] The Economist has traditionally—albeit not always consistently—persisted in referring to itself as a ""newspaper"", rather than a newsmagazine, due to the gradual pace of its transformation in format from newsprint to glossy colour (articles were printed on the front page into the 1950s) in addition to its general focus on current affairs as opposed to specialist subjects.[5]","The Economist's treatment of economics presumes a working familiarity with fundamental concepts of classical economics. For instance, it does not explain terms like invisible hand, macroeconomics, or demand curve, and may take just six or seven words to explain the theory of comparative advantage. Articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader and aim to be accessible to the educated layman. It usually does not translate short French (and German) quotes or phrases. It does describe the business or nature of even well-known entities, writing, for example, ""Goldman Sachs, an investment bank"".[60]","Many articles include some witticism; image captions are often humorous puns and the letters section usually concludes with an odd or light-hearted letter. These efforts at humour have sometimes had a mixed reception. For example, the cover of the 20 September 2003 issue, headlined by a story on the WTO ministerial meeting in Cancún, featured a cactus giving the middle finger.[61] Readers sent both positive and negative letters in response.[62]","Articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a byline. Not even the name of the editor (since 2015, Zanny Minton Beddoes[63]) is printed in the issue. It is a long-standing tradition that an editor's only signed article during their tenure is written on the occasion of their departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when journalists of The Economist compile special reports (previously known as surveys); for the Year in Review special edition; and to highlight a potential conflict of interest over a book review. The names of The Economist editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website.[64] Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note their authorship from their personal web sites.[65] ""This approach is not without its faults (we have four staff members with the initials ""J.P."", for example) but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines, in our view"", wrote one anonymous writer of The Economist.[66]","The editors say this is necessary because ""collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists""[67] and reflects ""a collaborative effort"".[68] In most articles, authors refer to themselves as ""your correspondent"" or ""this reviewer"". The writers of the titled opinion columns tend to refer to themselves by the title (hence, a sentence in the ""Lexington"" column might read ""Lexington was informed..."").","The American author Michael Lewis has criticised the magazine's editorial anonymity, labelling it a means to hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles. In 1991 Lewis quipped: ""The magazine is written by young people pretending to be old people ... If American readers got a look at the pimply complexions of their economic gurus, they would cancel their subscriptions in droves"".[69] It should be noted that, although individual articles are written anonymously, there is no secrecy over who are The Economist writers, since they publicly disclose it, for example on their social network accounts.[70]","John Ralston Saul describes The Economist as a ""...magazine which hides the names of the journalists who write its articles in order to create the illusion that they dispense disinterested truth rather than opinion. This sales technique, reminiscent of pre-Reformation Catholicism, is not surprising in a publication named after the social science most given to wild guesses and imaginary facts presented in the guise of inevitability and exactitude. That it is the Bible of the corporate executive indicates to what extent received wisdom is the daily bread of a managerial civilization.""[71]","Each of The Economist issue's official date range is from Saturday to the following Friday. The Economist posts each week's new content online at approximately 2100 Thursday evening UK time, ahead of the official publication date.","In 1877 the publication's circulation was 3,700, and in 1920 it had risen to 6,000. Circulation increased rapidly after 1945, reaching 100,000 by 1970.[24]","Circulation is audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC). From around 30,000 in 1960 it has risen to near 1 million by 2000 and by 2016 to about 1.3 million.[72] Sales inside North America were in 2007 around 54 per cent of the total, with sales in the UK making up 14 per cent of the total and continental Europe 19 per cent. The Economist claims sales, both by subscription and at newsagents, in over 200 countries. Of its American readers, two out of three earn more than $100,000 a year.[73]","The Economist once boasted about its limited circulation. In the early 1990s it used the slogan ""The Economist – not read by millions of people"". ""Never in the history of journalism has so much been read for so long by so few,"" wrote Geoffrey Crowther, a former editor.[74]","The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Economist Group. The publications of the group include the CFO brand family as well as the annual The World in..., the lifestyle bimonthly 1843, European Voice, and Roll Call. Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild was Chairman of the company from 1972 to 1989.","The Economist frequently receives letters from senior businesspeople, politicians, ambassadors, and from spokespeople for various government departments, non-governmental organisations and lobbies. Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of corporate social responsibility, published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from Oxfam, the World Food Programme, United Nations Global Compact, the Chairman of BT Group, an ex-Director of Shell and the UK Institute of Directors.[75]","Many of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary. After The Economist ran a critique of Amnesty International and human rights in general in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a vibrant reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.[76] Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local right-of-reply laws without compromising editorial independence.[77]","It is extremely rare for any comment by The Economist to appear alongside any published letter. Letters published in the news magazine are typically between 150 and 200 words long (and began with the salutation ""Sir"" until the editorship of Zanny Minton Beddoes, the first female editor; they now have no salutation). Previous to a change in procedure, all responses to on-line articles were usually published in ""The Inbox"".[78] Comments can now be made directly under each article.","The Economist's primary focus is world events, politics and business, but it also runs regular sections on science and technology as well as books and the arts. Approximately every two weeks, the publication includes an in-depth special report.[79] (previously called surveys) on a given topic. The five main categories are Countries and Regions, Business, Finance and Economics, Science and Technology, and Other. Every three months, it publishes a technology report called Technology Quarterly[80] or TQ, a special section focusing on recent trends and developments in science and technology.","Since July 2007 there has also been a complete audio edition of the news magazine available 9pm London time on Thursdays.[81] The audio version of The Economist is produced by the production company Talking Issues. The company records the full text of the news magazine in mp3 format, including the extra pages in the UK edition. The weekly 130 MB download is free for subscribers and available for a fee for non-subscribers.","The publication's writers adopt a tight style that seeks to include the maximum amount of information in a limited space.[82] David G. Bradley, publisher of The Atlantic, described the formula as ""a consistent world view expressed, consistently, in tight and engaging prose"".[83]","There is a section of economic statistics. Tables such as employment statistics are published each week and there are special statistical features too. It is unique among British weeklies in providing authoritative coverage of official statistics and its rankings of international statistics have been decisive.[84] In addition, The Economist is known for its Big Mac Index, which it first published in 1986, which uses the price of the hamburger in different countries as an informal measure of the purchasing power of currencies.[85][86]",The publication runs several opinion columns whose names reflect their topic:,Other regular features include:,"The news magazine goes to press on Thursdays, between 6pm and 7pm GMT, and is available at newsagents in many countries the next day. It is printed at seven sites around the world. Known on their website as ""This week's print edition"", it is available online, albeit with only the first five viewed articles being free (and available to subscribers only mid-October 2009 – 2010).","The Economist published in 2015 its first US college rankings, focused on comparable economical advantages defined as 'the economic value of a university is equal to the gap between how much its students subsequently earn, and how much they might have made had they studied elsewhere'. Based on set of strict criteria sourced from US Department of Education (""College Scorecard"") with relevant 'expected earnings' and multiple statistics applied in calculation of 'median earnings' conclusive evaluation method has been applied to run the scorecard's earnings data through a multiple regression analysis, a common method of measuring the relationships between variables.[93]",The Economist also produces the annual The World in [Year] publication. It also sponsors a writing award.,"The Economist sponsors the yearly ""Economist Innovation Awards"", in the categories of bioscience, computing and communications, energy and the environment, social and economic innovation, business-process innovation, consumer products, and a special ""no boundaries"" category.[94] The awards have been held since 2002. Nominations are held between 2 and 30 April. The award ceremony is then hosted on 15 November. Choices are based off the following factors:[95]","In 1999 The Economist organized a global futurist writing competition, The World in 2050. Co-sponsored by Royal Dutch/Shell, the competition included a first prize of US$20,000 and publication in The Economist's annual flagship publication, The World In.[96] Over 3,000 entries from around the world were submitted via a website set up for the purpose and at various Royal Dutch Shell offices worldwide.[96]","The judging panel included Bill Emmott,[96] Esther Dyson,[97] Sir Mark Moody-Stuart (then-chairman of Royal Dutch Shell),[96] and Matt Ridley (a British scientist and member of the House of Lords).[98]","Sections of The Economist criticising authoritarian regimes are frequently removed from the magazine by the authorities in those countries. The Economist regularly has difficulties with the ruling party of Singapore, the People's Action Party, which had successfully sued it, in a Singaporean court, for libel.[99]","The Economist, like many other publications, is subjected to censorship in India whenever it depicts a map of Kashmir. The maps are stamped by Indian Customs officials as being ""neither correct, nor authentic"". Issues are sometimes delayed, but not stopped or seized.[100]","On 15 June 2006 Iran banned the sale of The Economist when it published a map labelling the Persian Gulf simply as ""Gulf""—a choice that derives its political significance from the Persian Gulf naming dispute.[101]","In a separate incident, the government of Zimbabwe went further and imprisoned The Economist's correspondent there, Andrew Meldrum. The government charged him with violating a statute on ""publishing untruth"" for writing that a woman was decapitated by supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front party. The decapitation claim was retracted[102] and allegedly fabricated by the woman's husband. The correspondent was later acquitted, only to receive a deportation order.","On 19 August 2013 The Economist disclosed that the Missouri Department of Corrections had censored its issue of 29 June 2013. According to the letter sent by the department, prisoners were not allowed to receive the issue because ""1. it constitutes a threat to the security or discipline of the institution; 2. may facilitate or encourage criminal activity; or 3. may interfere with the rehabilitation of an offender"".[103]","In 1991 James Fallows argued in The Washington Post that The Economist used editorial lines that contradicted the news stories they purported to highlight.[69] In 1999 Andrew Sullivan complained in The New Republic that it uses ""marketing genius""[104] to make up for deficiencies in analysis and original reporting, resulting in ""a kind of Reader's Digest""[105] for America's corporate elite.[106] Although he acknowledged that the magazine's claim about the dotcom bubble bursting would probably be accurate in the long run (the bubble burst in the US market two years later),[107] Sullivan pointed out that the magazine greatly exaggerated the danger the US economy was in after the Dow Jones fell to 7,400 during the 1998 Labor Day weekend. He also said that The Economist is editorially constrained because so many scribes graduated from the same college at Oxford University, Magdalen College.[105] The Guardian wrote that ""its writers rarely see a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three-card trick of privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation"".[108]","In 2008 Jon Meacham, former editor of Newsweek and a self-described ""fan"", criticised The Economist's focus on analysis over original reporting.[109]","In 2012 The Economist was accused of hacking into the computer of Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, leading to his resignation as the chairman of the International Crimes Tribunal.[110][111][112][113][114][115] The magazine denied the accusations.","In 2014 the magazine withdrew a harshly-criticised review of a book by Edward Baptist on slavery and American capitalism; The Economist had complained that ""[a]lmost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains.""[116] Baptist attributed the harsh review to the magazine's adherence to ""free-market fundamentalist"" theories, ""the idea that everything would be better if measured first and last by its efficiency at producing profit.""[117]","In 2005 the Chicago Tribune named it the best English-language magazine noting its strength in international reporting ""where it does not feel moved to cover a faraway land only at a time of unmitigated disaster"" and that it kept a wall between its reporting and its more conservative editorial policies.[118]",
Coldplay,"Coldplay are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist and keyboardist Chris Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London (UCL).[5] After they formed under the name Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as bassist and they changed their name to Starfish.[6] Will Champion joined as drummer and backing vocalist, completing the lineup. Creative director Phil Harvey is often referred to as the fifth member by the band.[7] The band renamed themselves ""Coldplay"" in 1998,[8] before recording and releasing three EPs: Safety in 1998 and Brothers & Sisters and The Blue Room in 1999. The Blue Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.[9]","Coldplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single ""Yellow"" in 2000, followed in the same year by their debut album Parachutes, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to critical acclaim and won awards including NME's Album of the Year. Their next release, X&Y, the bestselling album worldwide in 2005, received mostly positive reviews, though some critics felt it was inferior to its predecessor. Their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), was produced by Brian Eno and released to largely positive reviews, earning several Grammy Award nominations and wins at the 51st Grammy Awards.[10] In October 2011, Coldplay released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which topped the charts in over 34 countries and was the UK's best-selling rock album of 2011, but received mixed reviews,[11] In May 2014, they released their sixth album, Ghost Stories, which also received mixed reviews and topped the iTunes Store albums charts in over 100 countries.[12] In December 2015, the band released their seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams, which reached the top two in most major markets, but received generally mixed reviews.","Coldplay have won 62 awards from 209 nominations throughout their career, including nine Brit Awards—winning Best British Group four times—five MTV Video Music Awards and seven Grammy Awards from 31 nominations. They have sold more than 80 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's bestselling music artists.[13] In December 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the fourth-best artist of the 2000s.[14] Coldplay have supported various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. They have also performed at charity projects including Band Aid 20, Live 8, Sound Relief, Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief, The Secret Policeman's Ball, Sport Relief and the UK Teenage Cancer Trust.[15]",,,"Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London (UCL) in September 1996.[16] The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz.[5] Guy Berryman, a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs.[6] Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was studying classics at the University of Oxford, to be the band's manager.[17] Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group.[8] The band's line-up was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and tin whistle; he quickly learned the drums (despite having no previous experience).[5] The band finally settled on the name ""Coldplay"" which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group.[8]","By 1997, Martin had met Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During a weekend in the English village Virginia Water in Surrey they asked each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's keyboard player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already active. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets.[18] In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the Safety EP.[19] Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda.[19] Their first release was the three-track Brothers and Sisters EP, which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999.[19]","After completing their final examinations Coldplay signed a five-album contract with Parlophone in early 1999.[9] After making their first appearance at Glastonbury the band went into the studio to record a third EP, titled The Blue Room.[20] Five thousand copies were made available to the public in October[21] and the single ""Bigger Stronger"" received BBC Radio 1 airplay. The recording sessions for The Blue Room were tumultuous. Champion was briefly fired from the band, but Martin later pleaded with him to return after kicking him out, and because of his guilt, went on a drinking binge. Eventually, the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact. Inspired by bands like U2 and R.E.M., Coldplay decided that they would operate as a democracy. Additionally, the band determined they would fire anyone who used hard drugs.[22]","The band initially planned to record their debut album in the space of two weeks. However, tours and other live performances caused the recording to spread out between September 1999 and April–May 2000.[23] The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios, Matrix Studios, and Wessex Sound Studios with producer Ken Nelson, although the majority of Parachutes' tracks were recorded at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios (where they accessed three studio rooms). The mixing process on all songs for the album was done by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York.[24] During that period, they played on the Carling Tour, which showcased up-and-coming acts.[25]","After releasing three EPs without a hit song, Coldplay had their first Top 40 hit with the lead single from Parachutes, ""Shiver"", which was released in March 2000 and peaked at number 35 position on the UK Singles Chart.[26] June 2000 was a pivotal moment in Coldplay's history: the band embarked on their first headlining tour, including a showing at the Glastonbury Festival. The band also released the breakthrough single ""Yellow"".[27] It was Coldplay's first release to reach the top five, rising to number four on the UK Singles Chart.[27] ""Yellow"" and ""Shiver"" were initially released as EPs in the spring of 2000.[28] The former was later released as a single in United Kingdom on 26 June 2000. In the United States, the song was released as the lead single from the then-untitled debut album. In October 2000, the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets.[29]","Coldplay released their first studio album, Parachutes, on 10 July 2000 in the United Kingdom via their record label, Parlophone. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart.[30] It was released on 7 November 2000 by record label Nettwerk in North America.[31] The album has been made available on various formats since its initial release; both Parlophone and Nettwerk released it as a CD in 2000, and it was also released as a cassette by US label Capitol in 2001. In the following year, Parlophone issued the album as an LP.[32] Four singles were released from Parachutes, including ""Shiver"" and ""Yellow"", and enjoyed popularity in the UK and US.[33] The third single was ""Trouble"", which reached number 10 in the UK charts.[34] It was released more than a year later in the US, and, although it did not make the Billboard Hot 100, it reached number 28 in the Alternative Songs chart.[35] In December 2001, the band released a limited-edition CD, Mince Spies, featuring a remix of ""Yellow"" and the Christmas song ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"". It was pressed to 1,000 copies, and was issued only to fans and journalists.[36]","Parachutes was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in September 2000.[37] Having found success in Europe, the band set their sights on North America,[38] by releasing the album there in November 2000, and started the US Club Tour in February 2001.[39] At the 2001 Brit Awards in February, Coldplay earned awards for Best British Group, and Best British Album.[40] Although Parachutes was a slow-burning success in the United States, it eventually reached double-platinum status.[41] The album was critically well received and earned a Best Alternative Music Album honours at the 2002 Grammy Awards.[42] Chris Martin claimed, after the release of Parachutes, that the album's success was intended to elevate the band's status to the ""biggest, best band in the world.""[43] After single-handedly managing the band until early 2001, Phil Harvey resigned from his role due to the stress of performing a role usually requiring a team of people. Harvey then took on the role of ""creative director"" and is often referred as the official fifth member by the band, while Dave Holmes took over as the band's manager.","After the success of Parachutes, Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, once again with Ken Nelson producing. Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. ""In My Place"" was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single because it was the track that made them want to record a second album, following a ""strange period of not really knowing what we were doing"" three months after the success of Parachutes. According to Martin ""one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming.""[44]","The band wrote more than 20 songs for the album. Some of their new material, including ""In My Place"" and ""Animals"", was played live while the band was still touring Parachutes.[36][45] The album's title was revealed through a post on the band's official website.[46] The album was released in August 2002 and spawned several popular singles, including ""In My Place"", ""Clocks"", and the ballad ""The Scientist"". The latter was inspired by George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, which was released in 1970.[47]","Coldplay toured from June 2002 to September 2003 for the A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour. They visited five continents, including co-headlining festival dates at Glastonbury Festival,[21] V2003 and Rock Werchter. Many concerts showcased elaborate lighting and individualised screens reminiscent of U2's Elevation Tour and Nine Inch Nails' Fragility Tour.[48] During the extended tour, Coldplay recorded a live DVD and CD, Live 2003, at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion.[49] At the 2003 Brit Awards held at Earls Court, London, Coldplay received awards for Best British Group, and Best British Album.[40] On 28 August 2003, Coldplay performed ""The Scientist"" at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and won three awards.[50]","In December 2003, readers of Rolling Stone chose Coldplay as the best artist and the best band of the year.[51] At that time the band covered The Pretenders' 1983 song ""2000 Miles"" (which was made available for download on their official website). ""2000 Miles"" was the top selling UK download that year, with proceeds from the sales donated to Future Forests and Stop Handgun Violence campaigns.[52] A Rush of Blood to the Head won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards.[53] At the 2004 Grammy Awards, Coldplay earned Record of the Year for ""Clocks"".[42]","Coldplay spent most of 2004 out of the spotlight, taking a break from touring and releasing a satire music video of a song from a fictional band titled The Nappies while recording their third album.[54] X&Y was released in June 2005 in UK and Europe.[55] This new, delayed release date had put the album back into the next fiscal year, actually causing EMI's stock to drop.[56][57] It became the best-selling album of 2005 with worldwide sales of 8.3 million.[58] The lead single, ""Speed of Sound"",[59] made its radio and online music store debut on 18 April and was released as a CD on 23 May 2005.[60] X&Y entered the album charts of 20 countries at the number one position[61] and was the third-fastest selling album in UK chart history.[62]","Two other singles were released that year: ""Fix You"" in September and ""Talk"" in December. Critical reaction to X&Y was mostly positive, though slightly less enthusiastic than that of its predecessor. The New York Times critic Jon Pareles described Coldplay as ""the most insufferable band of the decade"",[63] whereas NME awarded the album 9/10 calling it ""Confident, bold, ambitious, bunged with singles and impossible to contain, 'X&Y' doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does reinforce Coldplay as the band of their time"".[64] Comparisons between Coldplay and U2 became increasingly common.[65][66] Chris Martin later revealed that the reviews that ranged from mixed to negative, note-worthy for their remarks on comparing them to U2, made him feel ""liberated"".[67]","From June 2005 to March 2007, Coldplay went on their Twisted Logic Tour, which included festival dates like Coachella, Isle of Wight Festival, Glastonbury and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.[68] In July 2005, the band appeared at Live 8 in Hyde Park, where they played a rendition of The Verve's ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" with Richard Ashcroft on vocals.[69] On 28 August, Coldplay performed ""Speed of Sound"" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards in Miami.[70] In September, Coldplay recorded a new version of ""How You See the World"" with reworked lyrics for War Child's Help!: A Day in the Life charity album.[71] In February 2006, Coldplay earned Best Album and Best Single honours at the Brit Awards.[72] Two more singles were released during 2006, ""The Hardest Part"" and ""What If"".","In October 2006, Coldplay began work on their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, with producer Brian Eno.[73] Taking a break from recording, the band toured Latin America in early 2007, finishing the Twisted Logic Tour by performing in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.[74] After recording in churches and other venues in Latin America and Spain during their tour, the band said the album would likely reflect Hispanic influence.[75] The group spent the rest of the year recording most of the album with Eno.[76]","Martin described Viva la Vida as a new direction for Coldplay: a change from their past three albums, which they have referred to as a ""trilogy"".[77] He said the album featured less falsetto as he allowed his voice's lower register to take precedence.[77] Some songs, such as ""Violet Hill"", contain distorted guitar riffs and bluesy undertones.[77]","""Violet Hill"" was confirmed as the first single, with a radio release date of 29 April 2008.[78] After the first play, it was freely obtainable from Coldplay's website from 12:15 pm (GMT +0) for one week (achieving two million downloads),[79] until it became commercially available to download on 6 May.[80][81] ""Violet Hill"" entered the UK Top 10, US Top 40 (entering the Top 10 in the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart) and charted well in the rest of the world.[82] The title track, ""Viva la Vida"", was also released exclusively on iTunes. It became the band's first number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[83] and their first UK number one, based on download sales alone.[84] This was also the first Number One in the UK Singles Chart to be based solely on download sales.","Upon release, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends topped the album charts worldwide, and was the world's best-selling album of 2008.[85] It hit number one on the UK album chart, despite having come on the market only three days previously. In that time, it sold 302,000 copies; the BBC called it ""one of the fastest-selling records in UK history"".[86] By the end of June, it had set a new record for most-downloaded album ever.[87][88] In October 2008, Coldplay won two Q Awards for Best Album for Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and Best Act in the World Today.[89] On 9 November, Coldplay were named the World's Best Selling Act of 2008 at the World Music Awards in Monte Carlo.[90] They also picked up two other awards, World's Best Selling Rock Act and Great Britain's Best Selling Act.[91] The band followed up Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends with the Prospekt's March EP, which was released on 21 November 2008. The EP features tracks from the Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends sessions and,[92][93] as well as being available on its own, was issued as a bonus disc with later editions of Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends.[94] ""Life in Technicolor II"" was the only single released from the EP.","Coldplay began their Viva la Vida Tour in June, with a free concert at Brixton Academy in London.[95] This was followed two days later by a 45-minute performance that was broadcast live from outside BBC Television Centre.[96] Released in late 2008, ""Lost!"" became the third single from the album, featuring a new version with Jay-Z. After performing the opening set on 14 March 2009 for Sound Relief at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Coldplay headlined a sold-out concert later that same night.[97] Sound Relief is a benefit concert for victims of the Victorian Bushfire Crisis and the Queensland Floods.[98] On 4 December 2008, Joe Satriani filed a copyright infringement suit against Coldplay in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Satriani's suit asserted that the Coldplay song ""Viva la Vida"" includes ""substantial original portions"" of the Satriani song ""If I Could Fly"" from his 2004 album, Is There Love in Space?. The Coldplay song in question received two Grammy Awards for ""Song of the Year.""[99] The band denied the allegation.[100][101] An unspecified settlement was ultimately reached between the parties.[102]","Coldplay were nominated for four awards at the 2009 Brit Awards: British Group, British Live Act, British Single (""Viva la Vida"") and British Album (Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends).[103] At the 51st Grammy Awards in the same year, Coldplay won three Grammy Awards in the categories for Song of Year for ""Viva la Vida"", Best Rock Album for Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, and Best Vocal Pop Performance by a Duo or Group for ""Viva la Vida"".[104][105] A live album entitled LeftRightLeftRightLeft was recorded at various shows during the tour. LeftRightLeftRightLeft, released on 15 May 2009, was to be given away at the remaining concerts of their Viva la Vida tour.

When Martin and Champion were interviewed by BBC Radio and asked about the album's lyrical themes, Martin replied ""It's about love, addiction, OCD, escape and working for someone you don't like.""[109] When asked whether or not their fifth album would be out by the summer, Martin and Champion said that there was plenty of work to be done before releasing it. They confirmed several festival appearances before its release date, including a headlining spot at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival,[110] T in the Park,[111] Austin City Limits Music Festival,[112] Rock in Rio,[113] and Lollapalooza festival.[114]","In an interview on 13 January 2011, Coldplay mentioned two new songs to be included on their upcoming fifth album, ""Princess of China"" and ""Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall"".[115] In a February interview, Parlophone president Miles Leonard told HitQuarters that the band were still in the studio working on the album and that he expected the final version would appear ""towards the autumn of this year"".[116] On 31 May 2011, Coldplay announced that ""Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall"" was to be the first single for the fifth album.

The Mylo Xyloto Tour was named the fourth-highest-grossing tour worldwide of 2012 with more than $171.3 million earned in ticket sales.[135]","Speaking to Australian radio station 2Day FM, Chris Martin revealed that the title for their next album: ""is much easier to pronounce.""[134] Martin debunked speculation that they were taking a break from touring by saying, ""This three-year break idea only came about because I said at a gig in Australia that we might not be back there for three years. That’s probably true, but that’s just how a world tour works. No chance are we taking a three-year break.”[136]","On 9 August 2013, Coldplay announced the release of their song, ""Atlas"", which featured on the soundtrack for the film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.[137] Its release got pushed back to 6 September 2013 (everywhere but the UK) and 8 September (UK).

The tone of the band's first studio album Parachutes, which saw them emerge as one of the most prominent modern bands in British popular culture, was described as melodic pop with ""distorted guitar riffs and swishing percussion"" but also being ""exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive"".[180] Such alternative rock style has been compared to bands like U2, Oasis, Radiohead and Travis.[180][181] The band acknowledges the Scottish alternative rock band, Travis, as a major influence on their earlier material.[182]","In their second studio album A Rush of Blood to the Head, the band drew inspiration from artists like Echo & the Bunnymen,[183] Kate Bush, George Harrison[47] and Muse.[184] The songs in it were considered to contain ""lush melodies and a heartbreak"" and that they had a ""newfound confidence.""[185] The music on their third release X&Y has been considered to be ""ruminations on Martin's doubts, fears, hopes, and loves.""[178] It was particularly influenced by the artists Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk.[186]","In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, the group's style was moving towards art rock, being influenced by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine.[187] The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and further so.[188][189] Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from the love and war-induced Viva la Vida. It also expands the spectrum by including electronic & acoustic elements, featuring upbeat tones for the first time and predominantly being a pop rock album, in stark contrast to the band's previous works. Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose.[190]","Regarding the band's wide international success, Parlophone's president Miles Leonard has stated that one of Coldplay's ""secrets"" is that they have never sounded like a parochial UK artist, saying: ""Some bands are very proud to be British, but sometimes come across as being very ‘British’. Coldplay never aspire to that; on one hand they sound British but on the other they sound like a huge global artist.""[116] In 2011 Coldplay were hailed as 'rock statesmen'.[191]","Despite their worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay turned down multi-million dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs ""Yellow"", ""Trouble"", and ""Don't Panic"" respectively.[192] According to frontman, Chris Martin, ""We wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs' meanings like that.""[192] The song ""Viva la Vida"" was featured in a commercial for the iTunes Store, advertising its exclusive availability of the single as a digital download on iTunes.[193] Additionally, Chris Martin appeared at an Apple Inc.

It isn't very much effort for us at all, but if it can help people, then we want to do it.""[196] The band also asks that any gifts intended for them are donated to charity, according to a response on the FAQ section of Coldplay's website. Martin spoke out against the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the US, UK and other forces during the Teenage Cancer Trust show at London's Royal Albert Hall on 24 March 2003, where he encouraged the sell-out crowd to ""sing against war"".[202] He would later endorse the US Democratic presidential candidates John Kerry[203] and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 respectively.[204]","In June 2009, Coldplay began supporting Meat Free Monday, a food campaign started by Paul McCartney which attempts to help slow climate change by having at least one meat free day a week.[205] From 17 and 31 December 2009, Coldplay auctioned a quantity of significant band memorabilia, including their first guitars.

In less than a day 12,000 comments were made on that post. Some threatened to boycott the band, and a Facebook group was created that demanded an apology to Israel.[208] The link to the song was eventually removed from their Facebook wall.[209] According to Frank Barat of OneWorld, the link was not removed by Coldplay, but by Facebook after ""thousands of people (and computer generated posts) reported it as abusive.""[210]","Album Artists (www.albumartists.co.uk) staged an exhibition of art from Mylo Xyloto at Proud Gallery in Camden to support the charity Kids Company in November—December 2012.[211] The exhibition raised over £610,000 for the children's charity which supports disadvantaged children in London.[212] In November 2014, Martin joined the charity group Band Aid 30, performing alongside current British and Irish pop acts on the latest version of the track ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa—this was the second time Martin has contributed to a Band Aid recording having performed in the 2004 version (Band Aid 20).[213]","In June 2016 the band supported Vote Remain in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.

Reid, who offered to sign him that day. ""I knew that Chris had real talent,"" says Davis. ""I just knew I wanted to be part of it.""[20]","The negotiations with Def Jam continued for two months, and Davis then lost her job due to a corporate merger. Brown asked her to be his manager, and once Davis accepted, she promoted the singer to labels such as Jive Records, J-Records and Warner Bros. Records. According to Mark Pitts in an interview with HitQuarters, Davis presented Brown with a video recording, and Pitts' reaction was: ""I saw the potential ... I didn't love all the records, but I loved his voice. It wasn't a problem because I knew that he could sing, and I knew how to make records.""[21] Brown ultimately chose Jive due to its successful work with then-young acts such as Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake.

From 1995 to 1997, the channel used relatively few graphics to display the name of the channel, with the studio modelled on that used for BBC News in the United Kingdom.","As part of a major BBC corporate redesign (which included a new logo for the corporation on 4 October 1997) the channel received its first main refresh on 9 November 1997, the day BBC News 24 was launched. Various fictional flags with some real ones were used. The idents were computer generated and developed by the Lambie-Nairn design agency.","Another large relaunch for BBC World took place on 3 April 2000,[5] which brought it in line with the BBC's UK news channel which was relaunched in 1999. The new uniform look was made up of red and cream designed by Lambie-Nairn, with music based on a style described as 'drums and beeps' composed by David Lowe, a departure from the general orchestral versions of other news programmes.","On 8 December 2003 a second makeover, using the same 'drums and beeps' style music but new graphics took place, although on a much smaller scale to that of 1999. The music was changed slightly while the main colour scheme became black and red, with studios using frosted glass, white and red colours. Later in 2004, the channel's slogan became Putting News First, replacing Demand a Broader View. The graphical refresh introduced in 2003 was refreshed in May 2006 with a more red output. On 22 January 2007 a new refresh was presented based on the previous graphics, a red coloured labels covering a red and black earthglobe along with the BBC World logo.","The channel's present name was introduced on 21 April 2008 as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output and visual identity. BBC World News later moved to the renovated former studio of BBC News 24 (now BBC News). New graphics were produced by the Lambie-Nairn design agency and music reworked by David Lowe.",BBC World News relocated to Broadcasting House from its previous home at BBC Television Centre on 14 January 2013. This was part of the move of BBC News and other audio and vision departments of the BBC into one building in Central London. Broadcasting House was refurbished at a cost of £1 billion with a new newsroom and several state-of-the-art news television studios being built.[6],Live news output originates from studios B and C in Broadcasting House with some recorded programming from Broadcasting House studio A and the BBC Millbank studio. The BBC World News newsroom is now part of the new consolidated BBC Newsroom in Broadcasting House along with BBC World Service and UK domestic News services.,"Previously, the channel was broadcast in 4:3, with the news output fitted into a 14:9 frame for both digital and analogue broadcasting, resulting in black bands at the top and bottom of the screen. On 13 January 2009 at 09:57 GMT, BBC World News switched its broadcast to 16:9 format, initially in Europe on Astra 1L satellite,[7] and Eutelsat Hot Bird 6 satellite to other broadcast feeds in the Asian region from 20 January 2009.","As a result of the move to Broadcasting House, BBC World News gained high-definition studios and equipment to be able to broadcast in high-definition. On 5 August 2013, BBC World News was offered as a High Definition (HD) feed across the Middle East when it launched its international HD channel on Arabsat. Arabsat was the BBC's first distribution partner in the Middle East to offer the award-winning news channel in HD.","On 1 April 2015 BBC World News in English started broadcasting in high definition from the 11.229 GHz/V transponder on Astra 1KR at the 19.2°E orbital position, available free-to-air to viewers with 60 cm dishes across Europe and coastal North Africa.[8]",BBC World News claims to be watched by a weekly audience of 74 million in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.[9] BBC World News is most commonly watched as a free-to-air (FTA) channel. The channel is available in Europe and many parts of the world via satellite (FTA) or cable platforms.,"In the United States, the channel is available through various providers[10] such as Cablevision, Comcast, Spectrum, Verizon FiOS, AT&T U-verse, and others.[11] As of 2014, U.S. distribution and advertising sales for the channel are handled by AMC Networks, who serves as the minority partner for the BBC's entertainment channel BBC America.[12][13]","In mid-2012, Livestation made BBC World News available as part of a subscription package with Sky International, Al Jazeera English, and EuroNews.[14] Livestation closed down in November, 2016.","On 30 June 2016, Sling made BBC World News available in the United States as part of their World News add-on package.[15]","The channel is not officially available as a stand-alone, full-time channel in the United Kingdom because it carries and is funded by advertising (BBC's domestic channels are funded by a television licence fee which households and establishments that want to watch television programmes as they are being broadcast must pay), although it can be easily received due to its 'free-to-air' status on many European satellite systems, including Astra and Hot Bird and is available in selected London hotels. BBC World News can also be viewed in the public areas of Broadcasting House (the lobby and cafe).","However, some BBC World News programmes are available to UK audiences. There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of BBC World News on BBC One and the BBC News channel, followed by an edition of World Business Report. This programme was previously branded as 'The World Today'. While international audiences see advertisements during the break, UK viewers see domestic headlines. This simulcast is in addition to overnight simulcasts at the top of the hour from 00.00 to 05.00 UK time on both BBC World News and BBC News Channel and are simply branded as BBC News (except for Newsday which simulcasts at 00.00 UK time weekdays), even if they are produced by BBC World News. The 11:30 UK edition of BBC World News was shown on BBC Two Mon-Fri (but not on Wednesdays when Parliament is sitting and there is Prime Minister's Questions), but was discontinued as of December 2015, having been quietly replaced by the next half-hour of national BBC News (now known as Newsroom Live). This had formed BBC News at 11 on BBC Two, which was made up of half an hour of BBC News and then half an hour of BBC World News. Nowadays, this also happens on rare occasions during big news events and the News Channel presenter will join the BBC World News presenter in Studio C as it used by both channels. This was done for example for coverage of events such as the Glasgow Helicopter Crash, Election of Pope Francis and Boston Marathon Bombings. Previously GMT was shown at 12:30 on the channel.","BBC World News also produces a version of Outside Source at 19:00 and 21:00 weekdays or BBC World News UK time. The first half-hour of this programme can be seen in the UK on BBC Four or BBC News Channel on weekend. The edition of the programme replaced The World, which had been broadcast as a simulcast on the channel between 2002 and 2007. World News Today was dropped in March 2017 and replaced by a second edition of Outside Source.",Both World and the BBC News Channel have also occasionally had to simulcast the same news programme due to strike action or technical issues; this occurred in 2003 when Television Centre in London was affected by electrical problems.,Live news programmes:,Live business and sport programmes:,Pre-recorded programmes:,"Half-hour BBC World News bulletins are made available to Public Broadcasting Service member stations and networks in the United States through Los Angeles' KCET, a non-commercial independent public television station separate from PBS since the beginning of 2011 due to a rights fee dispute. 80 to 90% of Americans are able to receive them, though broadcast times vary between different localities, with it airing on several PBS stations in markets such as New York City and Washington DC.","On PBS stations, BBC World News does not appear with commercials (the breaks are replaced with news stories) but omits the Met Office international weather forecast at the end, replacing it with underwriting announcements. The PBS airings are tape-delayed on some stations.","BBC America airs a 3-hour block of BBC World News coverage from 05:00 to 08:00 on weekdays. Met Office forecasts are removed, and is broadcast with advertisements. Another BBC World News programme, the hour-long BBC World News America, aired on BBC America at 19:00 Eastern Time. A second broadcast at 22:00 Eastern Time ended in 2010 when BBC America introduced a second feed for the western time zones of the US on 18 February 2011, it was announced that BBC World News America would be discontinued on BBC America and would instead be airing only on BBC World and local PBS stations in the United States as a 30-minute program.[17]","BBC World News bulletins also appear on Hong Kong TVB English Channel instead of an NBC Nightly News simulcast from NBC News via its East Coast Feed from 07:30 until 08:00 Hong Kong Time (18:30 until 19:00 New York City Time), CCTV English News Live simulcasting on CCTV News from 12:00 until 13:00 Beijing/Hong Kong Time and News at 7:30 from 19:30 until 20:00 Hong Kong Time. In Singapore, the English daily evening-nightly flagship mainly news bulletins appear on: MediaCorp News Channel NewsAsia instead of Singapore Tonight from 22:00 until 23:00 Singapore Standard Time.","Previously, bulletins also featured on select rail services in both cities:","These broadcasts are treated to a specially recorded namecheck of ""Welcome to BBC World News on board the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit and Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway"". This short bulletin was updated twice a day, and has since been replaced by a similar programme from MediaCorp News Channel NewsAsia.","Travellers on the Heathrow Express rail service from London Paddington to London Heathrow Airport ware also treated to a specially recorded BBC World News bulletin—introduced with a namecheck of ""Welcome to BBC World News on board the Heathrow Express""—during the fifteen-minute journey. This short bulletin was updated twice a day, and was shown in both classes on LCD televisions throughout the train. However, a similar programme from Sky News is now shown instead.","Many airlines from across the world also play pre-recorded extracts of the BBC World News, have text headlines from it or have a full bulletin available on the in-flight entertainment systems. Airlines showing BBC World News include Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines, Myanmar Airways International, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, Air Canada and Qantas.","BBC World News is, for the most part, the same channel all over the world; the commercials are intended to be the only differences. However, there are some regional programming variations. For example, a number of programmes are made exclusively for regional viewings, such as Indian feeds, and The Record Europe, which is only broadcast in Europe.","On most feeds of BBC World News, when there are no commercials being inserted by the cable or satellite provider similar to other channels, the break filler shows promotions for upcoming programmes on the channel. During BBC News, a news story that has not been promoted airs during what would be the commercial break. This is the case on the broadband versions of BBC World News, and on versions of BBC World News aired in the United States on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations. However, there are some global commercials and sponsorships which air throughout the network.","On 11 September 2007, the break filler was redesigned and now more closely resembles previous versions[clarification needed]. The promotional videos now fill the entire screen and are interspersed with news and market updates, schedules, and other information. There is also no longer a unifying music composition. Instead, each 20-second promotional video uses music selected from a handful of themes, which have some unifying musical characteristics. The information screens, such as the 10-second plug for the website or YouTube channel, and the 15-second weather/time/coming up screens each feature their own theme. The colour theme was updated following the relaunch of the channel in April 2008.","Since its inception, and more so since its extensive association with the BBC News channel, the countdown to the hourly news bulletin has been a feature of the channel's presentation, accompanied by music composed by David Lowe. The current style of countdown features reporters and technical staff in many different locations working to bring news stories to air.","BBC World News was named Best International News Channel at the Association for International Broadcasting Awards in November 2006.[18] It won a Peabody Award in 2007 for White Horse Village""[19] and another in 2009 for ""Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence.""[20]"

Michael also has cerebral palsy and is a spokesperson for the advocacy organization Reaching for the Stars.[10] Michael's cardiomyopathy caused Kutcher's home life to become increasingly stressful. He has said that he ""didn't want to come home and find more bad news"" about his brother, stating, ""I kept myself so busy that I didn't allow myself to feel.""[11] Kutcher stated that, when he was 13, he contemplated committing suicide to save his brother's life with a heart transplant; when he told his father he was considering jumping from a Cedar Rapids hospital balcony, his father dissuaded him from doing so shortly before doctors announced that a transplant had become available from an accident victim in another state.[12]","Kutcher attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids for his freshman year, before his family moved to Homestead, Iowa, where he attended Clear Creek Amana High School. During high school, he developed a passion for acting and appeared in school plays. However, Kutcher's home life worsened as his parents divorced when he was 16. During his senior year, he broke into his high school at midnight with his cousin in an attempt to steal money; he was arrested leaving the scene. Kutcher was convicted of third-degree burglary and sentenced to three years' probation and 180 hours of community service. Kutcher stated that although the experience ""straightened him out"", he lost his girlfriend and anticipated college scholarships, and was ostracized at school and in his community.[13]","Kutcher enrolled at the University of Iowa in August 1996, where his planned major was biochemical engineering, motivated by the desire to find a cure for his brother's heart ailment.[6] At college, Kutcher was kicked out of his apartment for being too ""noisy"" and ""wild"".[14] Kutcher stated, ""I thought I knew everything but I didn't have a clue. I was partying, and I woke up many mornings not knowing what I had done the night before. I played way too hard. I am amazed I am not dead.""[15] To earn money for his tuition, Kutcher worked as a college summer hire in the cereal department for the General Mills plant in Cedar Rapids, and sometimes sold his blood.[16] While at the University of Iowa, he was approached by a model scout at a bar called The Airliner in Iowa City, Iowa,[17] and was recruited to enter the ""Fresh Faces of Iowa"" modeling competition. After placing first, he dropped out of college and won a trip to New York City to the International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Convention. After his stay in New York City, Kutcher returned to Cedar Rapids, before relocating to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.[14]","After participating in an IMTA competition (losing to Josh Duhamel) in 1998, Kutcher signed with Next modeling agency in New York, appeared in commercials for Calvin Klein, and modelled in Paris and Milan.[18]","After his success in modeling, Kutcher moved to Los Angeles after his first audition,[19] was cast as Michael Kelso in the television series That '70s Show, from 1998 to 2006.

He is also an executive producer of the reality television shows Beauty and the Geek, Adventures in Hollyhood (based around the rap group Three 6 Mafia), The Real Wedding Crashers, and the game show Opportunity Knocks. Many of his production credits, including Punk'd, come through Katalyst Films, a production company he runs with partner Jason Goldberg.[20] A 2004 interviewer described Kutcher as a ""hunky young actor [who] is heading in all different directions at once"", including ""the hot L.A. restaurant Dolce"":","""If anything, I'm a trier,"" says Kutcher between puffs of filtered Lucky Strikes. ""I think, more than anything, it comes from the fact that my father always had several irons in the fire. Also, I don't want to fail. If something doesn't work out—if That '70s Show got canceled or if I wasn't going to have a film career—I always wanted to have backup contingency plans. So I just started doing other things; and on a half-hour sitcom, you're really only working for 30 hours a week. It allows a lot of time for sitting around, which I always kind of filled with work.""[21]","Because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of The Guardian, Kutcher was forced not to renew his contract for the eighth and final season of That '70s Show, although he appeared in its first four episodes (credited as a special guest star) and returned for the series finale.[13] Kutcher produced and starred in the 2010 action comedy, Killers, in which he played a hitman.[22] In May 2011, Kutcher was announced as Charlie Sheen's replacement on the series Two and a Half Men.[23] Kutcher's contract was for one year and was believed to be worth nearly $20 million.[24] His debut as the character Walden Schmidt, entitled ""Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt"", was seen by 28.7 million people on September 19, 2011.

Mariah_Carey,"Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969 or 1970)[3] is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. In 1990, she rose to fame with the release of ""Vision of Love"" from her eponymous debut album. The album produced four chart-topping singles in the US and began what would become a string of commercially successful albums which solidified the singer as Columbia's highest selling act. Carey and Boyz II Men spent a record sixteen weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in 1995–96 with ""One Sweet Day,"" which remains the longest-running number-one song in US chart history. Following a contentious divorce from Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and traversed towards hip hop with the release of Butterfly (1997). In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards and subsequently named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000.","Carey parted with Columbia in 2000, and signed a record-breaking $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records America. In the weeks prior to the release of her film Glitter and its accompanying soundtrack in 2001, she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion. The project was poorly received and led to a general decline in the singer's career. Carey's recording contract was bought out for $50 million by Virgin and she signed a multi-million dollar deal with Island Records the following year. After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The album became the best-selling album in the US and the second best-seller worldwide in 2005 and produced ""We Belong Together,"" which became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named ""Song of the Decade"" by Billboard. Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received supporting role in Precious (2009), and was awarded the ""Breakthrough Performance Award"" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.","Throughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. According to the RIAA, she is the third-best-selling female artist in the United States, with 63.5 million certified albums. With the release of ""Touch My Body"" (2008), Carey gained her 18th number-one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist. In 2012, the singer was ranked second on VH1's list of the ""100 Greatest Women in Music."" Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won 5 Grammy Awards, 19 World Music Awards, 11 American Music Awards, and 14 Billboard Music Awards and has been consistently credited with inspiring a generation of singers.[4] Referred to as the ""songbird supreme"" by the Guinness World Records, she is famed for her five-octave vocal range, power, melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register.",,,"Mariah Carey was born in Huntington, New York.[5][6] Her father, Alfred Roy Carey, was of African American and Afro-Venezuelan descent, while her mother, Patricia (née Hickey), is of Irish descent. The last name Carey was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco Núñez, after immigrating to New York.[7] Patricia was an occasional opera singer and vocal coach before she met Alfred in 1960.[6] As he began earning a living as an aeronautical engineer, the couple wed later that year, and moved into a small suburb in New York.[7] After their elopement, Patricia's family disowned her due to her marrying a black man. Carey later explained that growing up, she felt a notion of neglect from her maternal family, a mark that affected her greatly.[7] During the years between the births of Carey's older sister Alison and herself, the Carey family struggled within the community due to their ethnicity.[7] Carey's name was derived from the song ""They Call the Wind Maria,"" originally from the 1951 Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon.[8][9] When Carey was three, her parents divorced.[10]","""It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself... my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everybody else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person ethnically. And sometimes, that can be a problem. If you look a certain way, everybody goes 'White girl', and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'""","After their separation, Alison moved in with her father, while the other two children, Mariah and brother Morgan, remained with their mother. Carey would grow apart from her father, and would later stop seeing him altogether.[10][12] By the age of four, Carey recalled that she had begun to sneak the radio under her covers at night, and just sing and try to find peace within the music.[12] During elementary school, she excelled in subjects that she enjoyed, such as music, art, and literature, but did not find interest in others. After several years of financial struggles, Patricia earned enough money to move her family into a stable and more affluent sector in New York.[13] Carey had begun writing poems and adding melodies to them, thus starting as a singer-songwriter while attending Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York,[14] where she graduated in 1987.[15] Carey excelled in her music, and demonstrated usage of the whistle register, though only beginning to master and control it through her training with her mother. Though introducing her daughter to classical opera, Patricia never pressured her to pursue a career in it, as she never seemed interested. Carey recalled that she kept her singer-songwriter works a secret and noted that Patricia had ""never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel.' I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me.""[14][16]","While in high school, Carey began writing songs with Gavin Christopher. They needed an assistant who could play the keyboard: ""We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled upon Ben [Margulies]. Ben came to the studio, and he really couldn't play the keyboards very well — he was really more of a drummer — but after that day, we kept in touch, and we sort of clicked as writers.""[16] Carey and Christopher began writing and composing songs in the basement of his father's store during Carey's senior year. After composing their first song together, ""Here We Go 'Round Again,"" which Carey described as having a Motown vibe, they continued writing material for a full-length demo.[17] She began living in a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, which she shared with four other female students.[18][19] Carey worked as a waitress for various restaurants, usually getting fired after two weeks.[20] While requiring work to pay for her rent, Carey still had musical ambitions, as she continued working late into the night with Margulies in hopes of completing a demo.[20] After completing her four song demo tape, Carey attempted to pass it to music labels, but failed each time.[21] Shortly thereafter, she was introduced to rising pop singer Brenda K. Starr.[21][22]","As Starr's friendship with Carey grew, so did her interest in helping Carey succeed in the industry. In December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a record executives' gala, where she handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola, who listened to it on his way back home.[23][24] After the first two songs, he was interested in her; later, after searching for Carey for two weeks, he immediately signed her and began mapping out her commercial debut.[23] While she maintained that she wanted to continue working with Margulies, Mottola enlisted top producers of the time, including Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.[23] Mottola and the staff at Columbia had planned to market Carey as their main female pop artist, competing with Whitney Houston and Madonna (signed to Arista and Sire Records respectively).[25] After the completion of her debut album, Mariah Carey, Columbia spent more than $1 million promoting it.[26] Despite a weak start, the album eventually reached the top of the Billboard 200, after Carey's exposure at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards.[27] Mariah Carey stayed atop the charts for eleven consecutive weeks,[28] and she won the Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance awards for her single ""Vision of Love.""[29] In addition to ""Vision of Love,"" the album yielded the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles ""Love Takes Time,"" ""Someday,"" and ""I Don't Wanna Cry.""[30] Carey became the first artist since The Jackson 5 to have its first four singles reach number one.[31] Mariah Carey finished as the best-selling album in the United States in 1991,[32] while totaling sales of over 15 million copies.[33]","Carey began recording her second studio album, Emotions, in 1991.[34][35] She described it as a homage to Motown soul music, as she felt the need to pay tribute to the type of music that had influenced her as a child.[35] For the project, Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Robert Clivillés and David Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory.[36] Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a personal contract Carey had signed with him before signing the record deal with Columbia, agreeing to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well. However, when the time came to write music for Emotions, Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album. Margulies later filed a lawsuit against Sony which ultimately led to their parting of ways.[35] Emotions was released on September 17, 1991, and was accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor.[37] While praised for Carey's improved songwriting, production, and new sound, the album was criticized for its material, thought weaker than that of her debut.[38] Though the album managed sales of over eight million copies globally, Emotions failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.[39]","As after the release of her debut, critics again questioned whether Carey would embark on a world tour to promote her material.[40] Although Carey explained that stage fright and the style of her songs made a tour very daunting, speculation grew that Carey was a ""studio worm,"" and that she was incapable of producing the perfect pitch and 5-octave vocal range for which she was known.[41][42] In hopes of putting to rest any claims of her being a manufactured artist, Carey and Walter Afanasieff decided to book an appearance on MTV Unplugged, a television program aired by MTV.[43] The show presented name artists ""unplugged"" or stripped of studio equipment.[43] While Carey favored her more soulful and powerful songs, it was decided that her most popular content would be included. Days before the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song, in order to provide something different and unexpected.[44] They chose ""I'll Be There,"" a song made popular by The Jackson 5 in 1970. On March 16, 1992, Carey recorded a seven-piece set-list at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York.[45] The revue was met with critical acclaim, leading to it being aired more than three times as often as an average episode would.[46] The success tempted Sony officials to market it.[47] Sony decided to release it as an EP, priced low because it was short. The EP proved to be a success, contrary to critics and speculations that Carey was just a studio artist,[48] and was given a triple-Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[49] and managed Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.[47]","""The writing partnership that her and I had and I can't speak for her other songwriting partners, but if you could see us in the room I would hit a chord and play a little melody on the piano and she would say, 'Oh, that's nice,' and she would sing that melody and then she adds a little bit to it. I would then play it back and then she would say, 'Yea, that's good' so it instantly becomes this partnership where eventually she'll have a melody and then the melody would prompt her to start thinking about this feeling she wants to put into words. This would eventually become the theme of the song.""","During early 1993, Carey began working on her third studio album, Music Box.[51] After Emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey and Columbia came to the agreement that the next album would contain a more pop influenced sound, in order to appeal to a wider audience.[51] During Carey's writing sessions, she began working mostly with Afanasieff, with whom she co-wrote and produced most of Music Box.[50] On August 31, Music Box was released around the world, debuting at number-one on the Billboard 200.[52] The album was met with mixed reception from music critics; while many praised the album's pop influence and strong content, others felt that Carey made less usage of her acclaimed vocal range.[53] Ron Wynn from AllMusic described Carey's different form of singing on the album: ""It was wise for Carey to display other elements of her approach, but sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion.""[54] The album's second single, ""Hero,"" would eventually come to be one of Carey's most popular and inspirational songs of her career.[55] The song became Carey's eighth chart topper in the United States,[55] and began expanding Carey's popularity throughout Europe. With the release of the album's third single, Carey achieved several career milestones. Her cover of Badfinger's ""Without You"" became her first number one single in Germany, Sweden,[56] and the United Kingdom.[57]","Music Box spent prolonged periods at number one on the album charts of several countries,[58] and eventually became one of the best-selling albums of all time, with worldwide sales of over 32 million copies.[50] After declining to tour for her past two albums, Carey agreed to embark on a short stateside string of concerts, titled the Music Box Tour.[59] Spanning only six dates across North America,[59] the short but successful tour was a large step for Carey, who dreaded the hassle of touring.[60] Following Music Box, Carey took a relatively large period of time away from the public eye, and began working on an unknown project throughout 1994.[61] In October 1994, Billboard announced that Carey would release a holiday album later that year.[61] That 1994, Carey recorded a duet with Luther Vandross; a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross's ""Endless Love.""[62] Carey's album Merry Christmas was released on November 1, 1994, on the same day that the album's first single, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You,"" was released.[63] The album eventually became the best-selling Christmas album of all time, with global sales reaching over 15 million copies.[64][65][66] Additionally, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" was critically lauded, and is considered ""one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon.""[64] Rolling Stone described it as a ""holiday standard,"" and ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list.[67] Commercially, it became the best-selling holiday ringtone of all time,[68] and the best-selling single by a non-Asian artist in Japan,[69] selling over 2.1 million units (both ringtone and digital download).[70][71] By the end of the holiday season of 1994, Carey and Afanasieff had already begun writing material for her next studio album, which would be released late the following year.[72]","Released on October 3, 1995, Daydream combined the pop sensibilities of Music Box with downbeat R&B and hip hop influences.[73] The album's second single, ""One Sweet Day"" was inspired by the death of David Cole.[74] The song remained atop the Hot 100 for a record-holding 16 weeks, and became the longest-running number-one song in history.[75] Daydream became her biggest-selling album in the United States,[76] and became her second album to be certified Diamond by the RIAA, following Music Box.[49] The album again was the best-seller by an international artist in Japan, shipping over 2.2 million copies,[77] and eventually reaching global sales of over 25 million units.[33] Critically, the album was heralded as Carey's best to date; The New York Times named it one of 1995's best albums, and wrote, ""best cuts bring R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement [...] Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés.""[78] Carey once again opted to embark on a short world tour titled Daydream World Tour. It had seven dates, three in Japan and four throughout Europe.[79] When tickets went on sale, Carey set records when all 150,000 tickets for her three shows at Japan's largest stadium, Tokyo Dome, sold out in under three hours, breaking the previous record held by The Rolling Stones.[79] Due to the album's success, Carey won two awards at the American Music Awards for her solo efforts: Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist.[80] Daydream and its singles were respectively nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards.[81] Carey, along with Boyz II Men, opened the event with a performance of ""One Sweet Day.""[82] However, Carey did not receive any award, prompting her to comment ""What can you do? I will never be disappointed again. After I sat through the whole show and didn't win once, I can handle anything.""[82] In 1995, due to Daydream's enormous Japanese sales, Billboard declared Carey the ""Overseas Artist of the Year"" in Japan.[83]","With her following albums, Carey began to take more initiative and control with her music, and started infusing more genres into her work.[84][85] For Butterfly, she sought to work with other producers and writers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Kamaal Fareed, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters.[85] During the album's recording, Carey and Mottola separated, with Carey citing it as her way of achieving freedom, and a new lease on life.[86] Aside from the album's different approach, critics took notice of Carey's altered style of singing, which she described as breathy vocals.[87] Her new-found style of singing was met with mixed reception; some critics felt this was a sign of maturity, that she did not feel the need to always show off her upper range,[88] while others felt it was a sign of her weakening and waning voice.[89][90] The album's lead single, ""Honey,"" and its accompanying music video, introduced a more overtly sexual image than Carey had ever demonstrated, and furthered reports of her freedom from Mottola.[91] Carey believed that her image was not ""that much of a departure from what I've done in the past [...] It's not like I went psycho and thought I would be a rapper. Personally, this album is about doing whatever the hell I wanted to do.""[91] Reviews for Butterfly were generally positive: Rolling Stone wrote, ""It's not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry [...] but the predominant mood of 'Butterfly' is one of coolly erotic reverie.""[92] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as ""sultrier and more controlled than ever,"" and heralded Butterfly as one of her ""best records and illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'""[93] The album was a commercial success, although not to the degree of her previous albums Mariah Carey, Music Box and Daydream.[94]","Carey began developing other projects during the late 1990s.[95] On April 14, 1998, Carey partook in the VH1 Divas benefit concert, where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan, and Carole King.[96] Carey had begun developing a film project All That Glitters, later re-titled to simply Glitter,[97] and wrote songs for other projects, such as Men in Black (1997) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000).[95] After Glitter fell into developmental hell, Carey postponed the project, and began writing material for a new album.[95] Sony Music executives wanted her to prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season.[98] They wanted to release an album that featured her number one singles in the United States, and her international chart toppers on the European versions, without any new material, while Carey felt that a compilation album should reflect on her most personal songs, not just her most commercial.[99] The album, titled #1's (1998), featured a duet with Whitney Houston, ""When You Believe,"" which was included on the soundtrack for The Prince of Egypt (1998).[99] #1's became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, making Carey as the only international artist to accomplish this feat.[100] It sold over 3.25 million copies in Japan after only the first three months, and holds the record as the best-selling album by a non-Asian artist.[100]","During the spring of 1999, Carey began working on the final album per her record contract with Sony.[101] But due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had developed with Sony, she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999, quicker than any of her other albums.[102] Titled Rainbow (1999), the album found Carey once again working with a new array of music producers and songwriters, such as Jay-Z and DJ Clue?.[103] Carey also wrote two ballads with David Foster and Diane Warren, whom she used to replace Afanasieff.[103] Rainbow was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first week sales of her career at the time, however debuting at number two on the Billboard 200.[104] In the meantime Carey's troubled relationship with Columbia grew, as they halted promotion after the album's first two singles.[104] They felt Rainbow didn't have any strong single to be released, whereas Carey wanted to release a ballad.[104] This led to a very public feud, as Carey began posting messages on her website, telling fans inside information on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request ""Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)"" on radio stations.[105] The song was ultimately released but Carey found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which made it commercially non-viable.[106] Critical reception of Rainbow was generally enthusiastic, with the Sunday Herald saying that the album ""sees her impressively tottering between soul ballads and collaborations with R&B heavyweights like Snoop Doggy Dogg and Usher [...] It's a polished collection of pop-soul.""[107] Though a commercial success, Rainbow became Carey's lowest selling album to that point in her career.[108]","After she received Billboard's Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium,[109] Carey parted from Columbia and signed a $100 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records America (EMI Records) in April 2001.[110] Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project.[110] She opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres, in order to go hand-in-hand with the film's setting.[111] She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Just a few months later, in July 2001, it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. She had left messages on her website that complained of being overworked,[112] and her three-year relationship with the singer Luis Miguel ended.[113] In an interview the following year, she said, ""I was with people who didn't really know me and I had no personal assistant. I'd do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night, if that.""[114] Due to the pressure from the media, her heavy work schedule and the split from Miguel, Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings.[115] On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL).[116] As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt, and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble.[116] While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention.[115] Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website: ""I'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [to] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.""[116] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been ""obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly"" when she posted the letters.[117]","On July 26, she was suddenly hospitalized, citing ""extreme exhaustion"" and a ""physical and emotional breakdown.""[118] Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public.[118] Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.[117][119] When discussing the project's weak commercial reaction, Carey blamed both her frame of mind during the time of its release, its postponement, as well as the soundtrack having been released on September 11.[120] Critics panned Glitter, as well as its accompanying soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially.[121] The accompanying soundtrack album, Glitter, became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch dismissed it as ""an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that, while not always critically heralded, was at least nearly consistently successful.""[122] Following the negative cloud that was enveloping Carey's personal life at the time, as well as the project's poor reception, her $100 million five-album record deal with Virgin Records America (EMI Records) was bought out for $50 million.[110][123] Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year.[115] Carey later said that her time at Virgin was ""a complete and total stress-fest [...] I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that.""[124] Later that year, she signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24 million,[125] and launched the record label MonarC. To add further to Carey's emotional burdens, her father, with whom she had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year.[126]","In 2002, Carey was cast in the independent film, WiseGirls, alongside Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters, who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and received generally negative critical response, though Carey's portrayal of the character was praised; Roger Friedman of Fox News referred to her as ""a Thelma Ritter for the new millennium,"" and wrote, ""Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs.""[127] Later that year, Carey performed the American national anthem to rave reviews at the Super Bowl XXXVI at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.[128] Towards the end of 2002, Carey released her next studio album Charmbracelet, which she said marked ""a new lease on life"" for her.[114] Though released in the wake of Glitter and Carey's return to the music scene, sales of Charmbracelet were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism. Joan Anderson from The Boston Globe declared the album ""the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos,""[129] while AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine expressed similar sentiments and wrote, ""What is a greater problem is that Mariah's voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs.""[130]","In April 2003, Carey announced she would be touring later in the year.[131] The Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, spanned North America and East Asia over three months, generally playing in smaller venues rather than arenas.[132] Throughout the United States, the shows were done in theaters, and something more Broadway-influenced, ""It's much more intimate so you'll feel like you had an experience. You experience a night with me.""[131] However, while smaller productions were booked throughout the tour's stateside leg, Carey performed at stadiums in Asia and Europe, performing for a crowd of over 35,000 in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China.[133] In the United Kingdom, it became Carey's first tour to feature shows outside London, booking arena stops in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.[134] Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey garnered generally positive reviews from music critics and concert goers, with many complimenting the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the production as a whole.[135]","Throughout 2004, Carey focused on composing material for her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The album found Carey working predominantly with Jermaine Dupri, as well as Bryan-Michael Cox, Manuel Seal, The Neptunes and Kanye West.[136] The album debuted atop the charts in several countries, and was warmly accepted by critics. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian defined it as ""cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again,""[137] while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote, ""The ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.""[138] The album's second single, ""We Belong Together,"" became a ""career re-defining""[139] song for Carey, at a point when many critics had considered her career over.[140] Music critics heralded the song as her ""return to form,""[141] as well as the ""return of The Voice,""[141] while many felt it would revive ""faith"" in Carey's potential as a balladeer.[136] ""We Belong Together"" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100.[142] After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second longest running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men, ""One Sweet Day.""[142] Billboard listed it as the ""song of the decade"" and the ninth most popular song of all time.[143] Besides its chart success, the song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.[144]","During the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first female to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as ""We Belong Together"" remained at number one, and her next single, ""Shake It Off"" moved into the number two spot (Ashanti had topped the chart in 2002 while being a ""featured"" singer on the number two single).[142] On the Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, the song was declared the number one song, a career first for Carey.[145] Billboard listed ""We Belong Together"" ninth on The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs and was declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by Billboard.[146] The album earned ten Grammy Award nominations in 2006–07: eight in 2006 for the original release (the most received by Carey in a single year),[147] and two in 2007 for the Ultra Platinum Edition (from which ""Don't Forget About Us"" became her seventeenth number-one hit). In 2006 Carey won Best Contemporary R&B Album for The Emancipation of Mimi, as well as Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song for ""We Belong Together.""[147] The Emancipation of Mimi was the best-selling album in the United States in 2005, with nearly five million units sold. It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album since Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill in 1996.[148] At the end of 2005, the IFPI reported that The Emancipation of Mimi had sold more than 7.7 million copies globally, and was the second-best-selling album of the year after Coldplay's X&Y. It was the best-selling album worldwide by a solo and female artist.[149][150][151] To date, The Emancipation of Mimi has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.[152] At the 48th Grammy Awards, Carey performed a medley of ""We Belong Together"" and ""Fly Like a Bird.""[153]","In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named The Adventures of Mimi: The Voice, The Hits, The Tour after a ""Carey-centric fan's"" music diary.[154] The tour spanned forty stops, with thirty-two in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan.[155] It received warm reaction from music critics and concert goers, many of which celebrated the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the show as a whole.[156][157] Carey played to about 60,000 fans in the two shows in Tunis.[158] The Adventures of Mimi DVD was released in November 2007 internationally and December 2007 in the US.","By spring 2007, Carey had begun to work on her eleventh studio album, E=MC², in a private villa in Anguilla.[159] Although E=MC² was well received by most critics,[160] some of them criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on The Emancipation of Mimi.[161] Two weeks before the album's release, ""Touch My Body,"" the record's lead single, reached the top position on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology.[162] Carey is second only to The Beatles, who have twenty number-one singles. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the Billboard chart history.""[163]","E=MC² debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career.[164] In 2008, Carey also played an aspiring singer named Krystal in Tennessee[165] and had a cameo appearance in Adam Sandler's film You Don't Mess with the Zohan, playing herself.[166] Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E=MC².[167] However the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008.[168] Carey later stated that she had been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage, hence she cancelled the tour.[169][170] On January 20, 2009, Carey performed ""Hero"" at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball after Barack Obama was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States.[171] On July 7, 2009, Carey – alongside Trey Lorenz – performed her version of The Jackson 5 song ""I'll Be There"" at the memorial service for Michael Jackson.[172]","In 2009, she appeared as a social worker in Precious, the movie adaptation of the 1996 novel Push by Sapphire.

Berger also said that ""Mariah has and continues to donate her time, money and countless hours of personal service to many organizations both here and abroad.""[234]","Declining offers to appear in commercials in the United States during her early career, Carey was not involved in brand marketing initiatives until 2006, when she participated in endorsements for Intel Centrino personal computers and launched a jewelry and accessories line for teenagers, Glamorized, in American Claire's and Icing stores.[249] During this period, as part of a partnership with Pepsi and Motorola, Carey recorded and promoted a series of exclusive ringtones, including ""Time of Your Life.""[250] She signed a licensing deal with the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, and in 2007, she released her own fragrance, ""M.""[251] The Elizabeth Arden deal has netted her $150 million.[252] In 2007, Forbes named her as the fifth richest woman in entertainment, with an estimated net worth of US$270 million.[253][254] In November 2011, it was reported that Carey's net worth was valued at more than $500 million.[2][201] On November 29, 2010, she debuted a collection on HSN, which included jewelry, shoes and fragrances.[255] In November 2011, Carey was announced as the new global ambassador for Jenny Craig, following her weight loss with the program after giving birth to fraternal twins in April.

I grew up with this music.""[259] She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as The Sugarhill Gang, Eric B. & Rakim, the Wu-Tang Clan, The Notorious B.I.G. and Mobb Deep, with whom she collaborated on the single ""The Roof (Back in Time)"" (1998).[260] Carey was heavily influenced by Minnie Riperton, and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range.[260]","During Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to Whitney Houston, who she has also cited as an influence,[261] and Celine Dion. Carey and her peers, according to Garry Mulholland, are ""the princesses of wails [...] virtuoso vocalists who blend chart-oriented pop with mature MOR torch song.""[262] Author and writer Lucy O'Brien attributed the comeback of Barbra Streisand's ""old-fashioned showgirl"" to Carey and Dion, and described them and Houston as ""groomed, airbrushed and overblown to perfection.""[262] Carey's musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were, in part, initiated to distance herself from this image, and she subsequently said that most of her early work was ""schmaltzy MOR.""[262] Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion, Carey co-writes and produces her own songs.[263]","Love is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as racism, social alienation, death, world hunger, and spirituality. She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but Time magazine wrote: ""If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life. Her songs are often sugary and artificial—NutraSweet soul. But her life has passion and conflict,"" applying it to the first stages of her career. He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material.[264] Jim Faber of the New York Daily News, made similar comments, ""For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it. Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening.""[265] While reviewing Music Box, Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone commented that Carey sang with ""sustained passion,"" while Arion Berger of Entertainment Weekly wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes ""too overwhelmed to put her passion into words.""[266] In 2001, The Village Voice wrote in regards to what they considered Carey's ""centerless ballads,"" writing, ""Carey's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless [Diane] Warren ballads [.....] it's largely because of [Blige] that the new R&B demands a greater range of emotional expression, smarter poetry, more from-the-gut testifying, and less [sic] unnecessary notes than the squeaky-clean and just plain squeaky Mariah era. Nowadays it's the Christina Aguileras and Jessica Simpsons who awkwardly oversing, while the women with roof-raising lung power keep it in check when tune or lyric demands.""[267]","Carey's output makes use of electronic instruments such as drum machines,[136] keyboards and synthesizers.[268] Many of her songs contain piano-driven melodies,[269] as she was given piano lessons when she was six years old.[10] Carey said that she cannot read sheet music and prefers to collaborate with a pianist when composing her material, but feels that it is easier to experiment with faster and less conventional melodies and chord progressions using this technique.[10] While Carey learned to play the piano at a young age, and incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music, she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset: ""My voice is my instrument; it always has been.""[94] Carey began commissioning remixes of her material early in her career and helped to spearhead the practice of recording entirely new vocals for remixes.[270] Disc jockey David Morales has collaborated with Carey on several occasions, starting with ""Dreamlover"" (1993), which popularized the tradition of remixing R&B songs into house records, and which Slant magazine named one of the greatest dance songs of all time.[271] From ""Fantasy"" (1995) onward, Carey enlisted both hip-hop and house producers to re-structure her album compositions.[82] Entertainment Weekly included two remixes of ""Fantasy"" on a list of Carey's greatest recordings compiled in 2005: a National Dance Music Award-winning remix produced by Morales, and a Sean Combs production featuring rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard.[272] The latter has been credited with popularizing the R&B/hip-hop collaboration trend that has continued into the 2000s, through artists such as Ashanti and Beyoncé.[270] Combs said that Carey ""knows the importance of mixes, so you feel like you're with an artist who appreciates your work—an artist who wants to come up with something with you.""[273]","""I have nodules on my vocal cords. My mother says I've had them since I was a kid. That's why I have the high register and the belting register and I can still be husky. A lot of people couldn't sing through the nodules the way I do; I've learned to sing through my vocal cords. The only thing that really affects my voice is sleep. Sometimes if I'm exhausted, I can't hit the really high notes. My doctors showed me my vocal cords and why I can hit those high notes. It's a certain part of the cord that not many people use—the very top. My natural voice is low. I have a raspy voice. I'm really more of an alto. But my airy voice can be high if I'm rested. [...] When I was little, I'd talk in this really high whisper, and my mom would be like, 'You're being ridiculous'. I thought if I can talk like that I can sing like that. So I started just messing around with it. I'd practice and practice, and she'd be like, 'You're gonna hurt yourself'. I'd tell her, it doesn't hurt. If I were to try and belt two octaves lower than that, that would be a strain.""","Carey possesses a five-octave vocal range,[275][276][277] and has the ability to reach notes beyond the 7th octave.[278][279] Referred to as the ""songbird supreme"" by the Guinness World Records,[263] she was ranked first in a 2003 MTV and Blender magazine countdown of the 22 Greatest Voices in Music, as voted by fans and readers in an online poll. Carey said of the poll, ""What it really means is voice of the MTV generation. Of course, it's an enormous compliment, but I don't feel that way about myself.""[280] She also placed second in Cove magazine's list of ""The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists.""[281]","Regarding her voice type, Carey said that she is an alto, though several critics have described her as a soprano.[282][283][284] However, within contemporary forms of music, singers are classified by the style of music they sing. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music.[285] Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing, but they are controversial,[285] because the development of classical voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would amplify his or her voice with their natural resonators, without a microphone.[286]","Jon Pareles of The New York Times described Carey's lower register as a ""rich, husky alto"" that extends to ""dog-whistle high notes.""[287] Additionally, towards the late 1990s, Carey began incorporating breathy vocals into her material.[288] Tim Levell from the BBC News described her vocals as ""sultry close-to-the-mic breathiness,""[288] while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote ""it's impossible to deny the impact her vocal style, a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting, has had on today's young pop and R&B stars.""[289]","Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker adds her timbre possesses various colors, saying, ""Carey's sound changes with nearly every line, mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid, breathy coo. Her wide vocal range allows Carey to take melodies from alto bottom notes to coloratura soprano upper register.""[64] Carey also possesses a ""whisper register."" In an interview with the singer, Ron Givens of Entertainment Weekly described it this way, ""first, a rippling, soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat: alto. Then, after a quick breath, she goes for the stratosphere, with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room. In one brief swoop, she seems to squeal and roar at the same time.""[290]","Her sense of pitch is admired[287] and Jon Pareles adds ""she can linger over sensual turns, growl with playful confidence, syncopate like a scat singer... with startlingly exact pitch.""[287]","Carey's vocal style and singing ability have significantly impacted popular and contemporary music. As music critic G. Brown from The Denver Post wrote, ""For better or worse, Mariah Carey's five-octave range and melismatic style have influenced a generation of pop singers.""[291] According to Rolling Stone, ""Her mastery of melisma, the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like ""Vision of Love,"" inspired the entire American Idol vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R&B singer since the Nineties.""[292] Jody Rosen of Slate wrote of Carey's influence in modern music, calling her the most influential vocal stylist of the last two decades, the person who made rococo melismatic singing.[293] Rosen further exemplified Carey's influence by drawing parallel with American Idol, which to her, ""often played out as a clash of melisma-mad Mariah wannabes. And, today, nearly 20 years after Carey's debut, major labels continue to bet the farm on young stars such as the winner of Britain's X Factor show, Leona Lewis, with her Generation Next gloss on Mariah's big voice and big hair.""[293] Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times wrote, ""Depending on how you feel about public humiliation, the best/worst parts of American Idol are the audition shows, which normally break down into three distinct parts:(1) The Talented Kids.(2) The Weird Kids.(3) The Mariahs."" Daly further commented, ""The Mariahs are the hardest ones to watch, mainly because most of them think they're reeeaaally good. The poor, disillusioned hopefuls plant themselves in front of judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson – then proceed to stretch, break and mutilate every note of a song, often Mariah's Hero, a tune that has ruined more throats than smoker's cough.""[294] New York Magazine's editor Roger Deckker said that in regarding Carey as an influential artist in music, he commented that ""Whitney Houston may have introduced melisma (the vocally acrobatic style of lending a word an extra syllable or twenty) to the charts, but it was Mariah—with her jaw-dropping range—who made it into America's default sound."" Deckker also added that ""Every time you turn on American Idol, you are watching her children.""[295] Despite her vocal prowess, Carey's vocal technique particularly with the use of melisma and belting, has been subject to public scrutiny mainly because of young singers such as from talent shows have been overly imitating her singing technique in which critics commented ""Mariah Carey is, without a doubt, the worst thing to happen to amateur singing since the karaoke machine.""[294] As Professor Katherine L. Meizel noted in her book, The Mediation of Identity Politics in American Idol, ""Carey's influence not just stops in the emulation of melisma or her singing amongst the wannabe's, it's also her persona, her diva, her stardom which inspires them.... a pre-fame conic look.""[296]","Among the hip hop, pop, and R&B artists who have cited Carey as an influence are Aneeka,[297] Ariana Grande,[298] Britney Spears,[299] Beyoncé,[64] Katy Perry,[300] Lady Gaga,[301] Bridgit Mendler,[302] Christina Aguilera,[303] Jessica Simpson,[289] Rihanna,[304] Grimes,[305] Kelly Clarkson,[306] Nelly Furtado,[307] Bonnie McKee,[308] Leona Lewis,[309] Brandy Norwood,[292] Pink,[310] Mary J.

That's a testament to her talent. Her range is that amazing.""[320] Beyoncé credits Carey's singing and her song ""Vision of Love"" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal ""runs"" as a child, as well as helping her pursue a career as a musician.[64] Rihanna has stated that Carey is one of her major influences and idol.[304] Christina Aguilera said in the early stages of her career that Carey was a big influence in her singing career and one of her idols.[303] According to Pier Dominguez, author of Christina Aguilera: A star is made, Aguilera has stated how she loved listening to Whitney Houston, but it was Carey who had the biggest influence on her vocal styling. Carey's carefully choreographed image of a grown woman struck a chord with Aguilera. Her influence on Aguilera also grew from the fact that both are of mixed heritage.[321] Philip Brasor, editor of The Japan Times, expressed how Carey's vocal and melismatic style even influenced Asian singers. He wrote that Japanese singer Hikaru Utada ""sang what she heard, from the diaphragm and with her own take on the kind of melisma that became de rigueur in American pop after the ascendance of Mariah Carey.""[315] In an article titled ""Out With Mariah's Melisma, In With Kesha's Kick,"" writer David Browne of The New York Times discusses how the once ubiquitous melisma pop style suddenly lost in favor of the now ubiquitous autotune in which the former was heavily popularized by the likes of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Browne had commented ""But beginning two decades ago, melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn't before. Mariah Carey's debut hit from 1990, ""Vision of Love,"" followed two years later by Whitney Houston's version of ""I Will Always Love You,"" set the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder, longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard."" Browne further added ""A subsequent generation of singers, including Ms. Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé, built their careers around melisma. (Men like Brian McKnight and Tyrese also indulged in it, but women tended to dominate the form.)""[322]","Carey is also credited for introducing R&B and hip hop into mainstream pop culture, and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post-1995 songs. Sasha Frere-Jones, editor of The New Yorker commented, ""It became standard for R&B/hip-hop stars like Missy Elliott and Beyoncé, to combine melodies with rapped verses. And young white pop stars—including Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and 'N Sync—have spent much of the past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably R&B."" Moreover Jones concludes that ""[Carey's] idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male MCs of hip-hop changed R&B and, eventually, all of pop. Although now anyone is free to use this idea, the success of The Emancipation of Mimi suggests that it still belongs to Carey.""[64] Judnick Mayard, writer of The Fader, wrote that in regarding of R&B and hip hop collaboration, ""The champion of this movement is Mariah Carey."" Mayard also expressed that ""To this day ODB and Mariah may still be the best and most random hip hop collaboration of all time,"" citing that due to the record ""Fantasy,"" ""R&B and Hip-Hop were the best of step siblings.""[323] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote, ""In the mid-1990s Ms. Carey pioneered a subgenre that some people call the thug-love duet. Nowadays clean-cut pop stars are expected to collaborate with roughneck rappers, but when Ms. Carey teamed up with Ol' Dirty Bastard, of the Wu-Tang Clan, for the 1995 hit ""Fantasy (Remix),"" it was a surprise, and a smash.""[324] Aside from her pop culture and musical influence, Carey is credited for releasing a classic Christmas song called ""All I Want for Christmas Is You.""[325] In a retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker said, the ""charming"" song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it ""one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon.""[64] Rolling Stone ranked ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a ""holiday standard.""[326] In a review of her Greatest Hits album, Devon Powers of PopMatters writes that ""She has influenced countless female vocalists after her. At 32, she is already a living legend—even if she never sings another note.""[327] While reviewing a concert of Carey in Sydney, Elise Vout of MTV Australia wrote that ""it's not amazing choreography or high production value you're going to see, it's the larger than life personality, unique voice, and legend that is Mariah Carey.""[328]","Carey began dating Mottola while recording Music Box,[329] and married him on June 5, 1993.[102] After the release of Daydream and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time.[330] Carey's relationship with Mottola began to deteriorate, due to their growing creative differences in terms of her albums, as well as his controlling nature.[330] On May 30, 1997, the couple announced their separation,[331] with their divorced finalized by the time Mottola remarried on December 2, 2000.[332] Carey was in a three-year relationship with singer Luis Miguel from 1998 to 2001.[113]","Carey met actor and comedian Nick Cannon while they shot her music video for her song ""Bye Bye"" on an island off the coast of Antigua.[333] On April 30, 2008, Carey married Cannon in The Bahamas.[334] At 35 weeks into her pregnancy, she gave birth to their fraternal twins, Moroccan and Monroe, on April 30, 2011[335] via Cesarean section.[336]","In August 2014, Cannon confirmed he and Carey had separated a few months earlier.[337] He filed for divorce on December 12, 2014.[338]","On January 21, 2016, Carey and Australian billionaire James Packer announced that they were engaged.[339]","Carey is an active Episcopalian.[340] She stated in 2006: ""I do believe that I have been born again in a lot of ways. I think what I've changed are my priorities and my relationships with God. I feel the difference when I don't have my private moments to pray. ... I'm a fighter, but I learned that I'm not in charge. Whatever God wants to happen is what's going to happen. I feel like I've had endless second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chances. It's by the grace of God I'm still here.""[341]","Throughout Carey's career, she has collected many honors and awards, including the World Music Awards' Best Selling Female Artist of the Millennium, the Grammy's Best New Artist in 1991, and Billboard's Special Achievement Award for the Artist of the Decade during the 1990s.[342] In a career spanning over 20 years, Carey has sold over 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the biggest-selling artists in music history.[343][344] Carey is ranked as the best-selling female artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, with over 52 million copies sold.[345][346] Carey was ranked first in MTV and Blender magazine's 2003 countdown of the 22 Greatest Voices in Music, and was placed second in Cove magazine's list of ""The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists.""[281][347] Aside from her voice, she has become known for her songwriting.

Google,"Google is an American multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products. These include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, software, and hardware. Google was founded in 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, in California. Together, they own about 14 percent of its shares, and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google, Alphabet's leading subsidiary, will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructure, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.","Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Sheets and Slides), email (Gmail/Inbox), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), social networking (Google+), instant messaging and video chat (Google Allo/Duo/Hangouts), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and turn-by-turn navigation (Google Maps), video sharing (YouTube), notetaking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and in October 2016, it released multiple hardware products (including the Google Pixel smartphone, Home smart speaker, Wifi mesh wireless router, and Daydream View virtual reality headset). The new hardware chief, Rick Osterloh, stated: ""a lot of the innovation that we want to do now ends up requiring controlling the end-to-end user experience"". Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier. In February 2010, it announced Google Fiber, a fiber-optic infrastructure that was installed in Kansas City; in April 2015, it launched Project Fi in the United States, combining Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different providers; and in 2016, it announced the Google Station initiative to make public Wi-Fi around the world, which had already been deployed in India.","Alexa, a company that monitors commercial web traffic, lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world. Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube and Blogger. Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world for 4 consecutive years, but has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship, and search neutrality. Google's mission statement, from the outset, was ""to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"", and its unofficial slogan was ""Don't be evil"". In October 2015, the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase ""Do the right thing"".",,,"Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.[6]","While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[7] They called this new technology PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages, that linked back to the original site.[8][9]","Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine ""BackRub"", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[10][11][12] Eventually, they changed the name to Google, originating from a misspelling of the word ""googol"",[13][14] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[15] Originally, Google ran under Stanford University's website, with the domains google.stanford.edu and z.stanford.edu.[16][17]","The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,[18] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (Susan Wojcicki[6]) in Menlo Park, California. Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[6][19][20]","The first funding for Google was an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, given before Google was incorporated.[22] At least three other angel investors invested in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professor David Cheriton, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram. Author Ken Auletta claims that each (including Bechtolsheim) invested $250,000,[23] but other sources have reported a $100,000 level.[22]","After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[23] a new, $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[24] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital.[22]","Early in 1999, Brin and Page decided they wanted to sell Google to Excite. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer. Vinod Khosla, one of Excite's venture capitalists, talked the duo down to $750,000, but Bell still rejected it.[25]","Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later, on August 19, 2004. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[26]","At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[27][28] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[29][30] The sale of $1.67 bn (billion) gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23bn.[31] By January 2014, its market capitalization had grown to $397bn.[32] The vast majority of the 271 million shares remained under the control of Google, and many Google employees became instant paper millionaires. Yahoo!, a competitor of Google's, also benefitted because it owned 8.4 million shares of Google before the IPO took place.[33]","There were concerns that Google's IPO would lead to changes in company culture. Reasons ranged from shareholder pressure for employee benefit reductions to the fact that many company executives would become instant paper millionaires.[34] As a reply to this concern, co-founders Brin and Page promised in a report to potential investors that the IPO would not change the company's culture.[35] In 2005, articles in The New York Times and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[36][37][38][39][excessive citations] In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer, who also serves as the Director of Human Resources. The purpose of the Chief Culture Officer is to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on: a flat organization with a collaborative environment.[40] Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[41][42] In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged ""no cold call"" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[43]","The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[44] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market.[45] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[45] GOOG shares split into GOOG Class C shares and GOOGL class A shares.[46] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[47]","In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California, which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[48] The next year, against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine,[49] Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords.[6] In order to maintain an uncluttered page design and increase speed, advertisements were solely text-based. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bids and click-throughs, with bidding starting at five cents per click.[6]","This model of selling keyword advertising was first pioneered by Goto.com, an Idealab spin-off created by Bill Gross.[50][51] When the company changed names to Overture Services, it sued Google over alleged infringements of the company's pay-per-click and bidding patents. Overture Services would later be bought by Yahoo! and renamed Yahoo! Search Marketing. The case was then settled out of court; Google agreed to issue shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.[52]","In 2001, Google received a patent for its PageRank mechanism.[53] The patent was officially assigned to Stanford University and lists Lawrence Page as the inventor. In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.[54] The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed by a googol zeroes. The Googleplex interiors were designed by Clive Wilkinson Architects. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[55] By that time, the name ""Google"" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb ""google"" to be added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, denoted as: ""to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet"".[56][57] The first use of ""Google"" as a verb in pop culture happened on the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in 2002.[58]","In 2005, The Washington Post reported on a 700 percent increase in third-quarter profit for Google, largely thanks to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[59] In January 2008, all the data that passed through Google's MapReduce software component had an aggregated size of 20 petabytes per day.[60][61][62] In 2009, a CNN report about top political searches of 2009 noted that ""more than a billion searches"" are being typed into Google on a daily basis.[63] In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time, an 8.4 percent increase from May 2010 (931 million).[64]","2012 was the first year that Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue, topping 2011's $38 billion generated. Then-CEO Larry Page commented in January 2013, ""We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.""[65]","Google announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple, Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the ""health and well-being"" company would focus on ""the challenge of ageing and associated diseases"".[66]","Google celebrated its 15-year anniversary on September 27, 2013, and in 2016 it celebrated its 18th birthday with an animated Doodle shown on web browsers around the world.[67] although it has used other dates for its official birthday.[68] The reason for the choice of September 27 remains unclear, and a dispute with rival search engine Yahoo! Search in 2005 has been suggested as the cause.[69][70]","The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013; Google is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes Facebook, Intel, and Microsoft. Led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.[71]","The corporation's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[72] Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[73] In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new 1-million-sq-ft (93,000 sq m) office in London, which was due to open in 2016. The new premises, able to accommodate 4,500 employees, has been identified as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions in Britain.[74] According to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013,[75] 2014,[76] 2015,[77] and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[78]","In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored on a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own ""version control system"", called ""Piper"", and that ""when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done."" Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The ""Piper"" system spans 85 TB of data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day, and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, ""You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company’s software. ""Not only is the size of the repository increasing,"" Potvin explained, ""but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve.""[79][80]","As of October 2016, Google operates 70 offices in more than 40 countries.[81] Alexa, a company that monitors commercial web traffic, lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world.[82] Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube[83] and Blogger.[84]","In April 2016, Recode reported that Google had hired Rick Osterloh, Motorola Mobility's former President, to head Google's new hardware division.[85] Later, in October 2016, The Information reported that David Foster, Amazon.com's former Kindle hardware chief, had joined Google as hardware chief for a new brand of smartphones by Google.[86]","On October 4, 2016, Google held a press event, where it announced its intention to create more hardware. Rick Osterloh stated: ""a lot of the innovation that we want to do now ends up requiring controlling the end-to-end user experience"",[87] and introduced:","David Foster left Google in April 2017, after working at Google for six months.[92][93]","Google went through three major periods of acquisitions, spanning 2000–2009, 2010–2012, and 2014–2015.","Since 2001, Google has acquired many companies, primarily small venture capital-funded firms. In 2004, Google acquired Keyhole, Inc.[94] The start-up company developed a product called Earth Viewer that gave a three-dimensional view of the Earth. Google renamed the service Google Earth in 2005. Google acquired Urchin Software in April 2005, using their Urchin on Demand product (along with ideas from Adaptive Path's Measure Map) to create Google Analytics in 2006.","In October 2006, Google announced that it had acquired the video-sharing site YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[95][96] and the deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[97][98] Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as ""not material"" in a regulatory filing.[99] In May 2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 YouTube revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[100]","On April 13, 2007, Google reached an agreement to acquire DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.[101] Later that same year, Google purchased GrandCentral for $50 million.[102] The site would later be renamed Google Voice. On August 5, 2009, Google bought out its first public company, video software maker On2 Technologies, for $106.5 million.[103] Google also acquired Aardvark, a social networking search engine, for $50 million, and commented on its internal blog, ""we're looking forward to collaborating to see where we can take it"".[104] In April 2010, Google announced it had acquired a hardware startup, Agnilux.[105]","In addition to the many companies Google has purchased, the firm has partnered with other organizations for research, advertising, and other activities. For example, in 2005, Google partnered with NASA Ames Research Center to build 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of offices.[106] The offices would be used for research projects involving large-scale data management, nanotechnology, distributed computing, and the entrepreneurial space industry.","Google entered into a partnership with Sun Microsystems, in October 2005, to help share and distribute each other's technologies.[107] The company also partnered with AOL[108] to enhance each other's video search services.","Google's 2005 partnerships also included financing the new .mobi top-level domain for mobile devices, along with other companies including Microsoft, Nokia, and Ericsson.[109] Google would later launch ""AdSense for Mobile"", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.[110] Further extending its advertising reach, Google and Fox Interactive Media of News Corporation entered into a $900 million agreement to provide search and advertising on the then-popular social networking site MySpace.[111]","In 2007, Google began sponsoring NORAD Tracks Santa, displacing the former sponsor AOL. NORAD Tracks Santa purports to follow Santa Claus' progress on Christmas Eve,[112] using Google Earth to ""track Santa"" in 3-D for the first time.[113] Google-owned YouTube gave NORAD Tracks Santa its own channel.[114]","In 2008, Google developed a partnership with GeoEye to launch a satellite providing Google with high-resolution (0.41 m monochrome, 1.65 m color) imagery for Google Earth. The satellite was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on September 6, 2008.[115] Google also announced in 2008 that it was hosting an archive of Life Magazine's photographs. Some images in the archive were never published in the magazine.[116] The photos were watermarked and originally had copyright notices posted on all photos, regardless of public domain status.[117]","In 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by NextEra Energy Resources, will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty-percent stake in the project to get funding for its development.[118] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[119] The order specifically states that Google Energy—a subsidiary of Google—holds the rights ""for the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates"", but acknowledges that neither Google Energy nor its affiliates ""own or control any generation or transmission"" facilities.[120] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[121]","Also in 2010, Google purchased Global IP Solutions, a Norway-based company that provides web-based teleconferencing and other related services.

This occurred days after the Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation into the purchase.[123] Google acquired the company for an undisclosed amount.[124] In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of energy for 20 years.[125]","On April 4, 2011, The Globe and Mail reported that Google bid $900 million for 6000 Nortel Networks patents.[126]","On August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to-date when it announced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion[127][128] subject to approval from regulators in the United States and Europe. In a post on Google's blog, Google Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page revealed that the acquisition was a strategic move to strengthen Google's patent portfolio. The company's Android operating system has come under fire in an industry-wide patent battle, as Apple and Microsoft have sued Android device makers such as HTC, Samsung, and Motorola.[129] The merger was completed on May 22, 2012, after the approval of People's Republic of China.[130]","This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[131] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[129] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[132] After the acquisition closed, Google began to restructure the Motorola business to fit Google's strategy. On August 13, 2012, Google announced plans to lay off 4000 Motorola Mobility employees.[133] On December 10, 2012, Google sold the manufacturing operations of Motorola Mobility to Flextronics for $75 million.[134] As a part of the agreement, Flextronics will manufacture undisclosed Android and other mobile devices.[135] On December 19, 2012, Google sold the Motorola Home business division of Motorola Mobility to Arris Group for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.

The company kept the extensive patent collection used to develop Android products, considered the most valuable part of the original deal.[149] Nonetheless, the sale price was significantly less than the $12.5 billion Google had bought Motorola Mobility for. The $2.91bn price tag consisted of $660 million in cash, $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares, and a $1.5 billion 3-year promissory note.[150] In March 2014, Google confirmed it had purchased the remnants of gaming startup, Green Throttle Games, which developed a Bluetooth gaming controller for Android.[151]","In May 2014, Google announced it had purchased Quest Visual, maker of the augmented reality translator app Word Lens.[152] In June 2014, Google purchased satellite imaging firm Skybox Imaging for $500 million.[153] In July 2014, Google purchased the online music service Songza.[154]","On September 10, 2015, Google announced to form strategic partnership with Mobvoi to bring Android Wear to mainland China.[155] In October 2015, Google invested in a China-based artificial intelligence (AI) company, Mobvoi.

Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that ""since the wind doesn’t blow 24 hours a day, we’ll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day"". Additionally, the project will ""help support communities"" around the world, as the purchase commitments will ""result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally"", and will ""generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue"".[171][172][173]","On August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet.

Google's AdWords allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through either a cost-per-click or cost-per-view scheme. The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[182]","One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[183]","In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of Oceana, a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating ""Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations.""[184] The policy was later changed.[185] In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because of antitrust concerns by the U.S. Department of Justice. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.[186][187]","In an attempt to advertise its own products, Google launched a website called Demo Slam, developed to demonstrate technology demos of Google Products.[188]","According to market research published by comScore in November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%.[189] Google indexes billions[190] of web pages, so that users can search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators.","In 2003, The New York Times complained about Google's indexing, claiming that Google's caching of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.[191] In this case, the United States District Court of Nevada ruled in favor of Google in Field v.

The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books were allowed, into its new book search engine. The Authors Guild, a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.[196] Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada.[197] Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière (Éditions du Seuil) from its database.[198] In competition with Amazon.com, Google sells digital versions of new books.[199]","On July 21, 2010, in response to Bing, Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of thumbnails that enlarge when pointed at.

Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[354]","In 2007, Google launched a project centered on developing renewable energy, titled the ""Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal (RE<C)"" project.[355] However, the project was cancelled in 2014, after engineers Ross Koningstein and David Fork understood, after years of study, that ""best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change"", writing that they ""came to the conclusion that even if Google and others had led the way toward a wholesale adoption of renewable energy, that switch would not have resulted in significant reductions of carbon dioxide emissions"".[356]","In June 2013, The Washington Post reported that Google had donated $50,000 to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank that calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.[357]","In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe, who has called climate change a ""hoax"".[358] In 2014 Google cut ties with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google's own scientists because of ALEC's stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.[359]","In 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[360]",Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.[361],"Google's market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, including criticism of the company over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance,[362] search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content, and privacy.[363][364] Other criticisms include alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of others' intellectual property, concerns that its compilation of data may violate people's privacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly, restraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent infringement.","Google's mission statement, from the outset, was ""to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"",[365] and its unofficial slogan was ""Don't be evil"".[366] In October 2015, the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: ""Do the right thing"".[367] Google's commitment to such robust idealism has been increasingly called into doubt due to a number of the firm's actions and behaviours which appear to contradict this.[368][369]","Following media reports about PRISM, NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[370] According to leaks of said program, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009.[371]"
Reuters,"Reuters /ˈrɔɪtərz/ is an international news agency headquartered in London, England. It is a division of Thomson Reuters.","Until 2008, the Reuters news agency formed part of an independent company, Reuters Group plc, which was also a provider of financial market data. Since the acquisition of Reuters Group by the Thomson Corporation in 2008, the Reuters news agency has been a part of Thomson Reuters, making up the media division. Reuters transmits news in English, French, Arabic, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Urdu, and Chinese. It was established in 1851.",,,"The Reuter agency was established in 1851 by Paul Julius Reuter in Britain at the London Royal Exchange. Paul Reuter worked at a book-publishing firm in Berlin and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets at the beginning of the Revolutions in 1848. These publications brought much attention to Reuter, who in 1850 developed a prototype news service in Aachen using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy from 1851 on in order to transmit messages between Brussels and Aachen.[2]","Upon moving to England, he founded Reuter's Telegram Company in 1851. Headquartered in London, the company initially covered commercial news, serving banks, brokerage houses, and business firms.[2] The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London Morning Advertiser in 1858.[2][3] Afterwards more newspapers signed up, with Britannica Encyclopedia writing that ""the value of Reuters to newspapers lay not only in the financial news it provided but in its ability to be the first to report on stories of international importance.""[2] Reuter's agency built a reputation in Europe and the rest of the world as the first to report news scoops from abroad.[4] Reuters was the first to report Abraham Lincoln's assassination in Europe, for instance, in 1865.[2][4] In 1872, Reuters expanded into the far east, followed by South America in 1874. Both expansions were made possible by advances in overland telegraphs and undersea cables.[4] In 1883, Reuters began transmitting messages electrically to London newspapers.[4]","In 1923, Reuters began using radio to transmit news internationally, a pioneering act.[4] In 1925, The Press Association (PA) of Great Britain acquired a majority interest in Reuters, and full owners some years later.[2] During the world wars, The Guardian reported that Reuters ""came under pressure from the British government to serve national interests. In 1941 Reuters deflected the pressure by restructuring itself as a private company."" The new owners formed the Reuters Trust.[4] In 1941, the PA sold half of Reuters to the Newspaper Proprieters' Association, and co-ownership was expanded in 1947 to associations that represented daily newspapers in New Zealand and Australia.[2] The Reuters Trust Principles were put in place to maintain the company's independence.[1] At ""that point, Reuters had become ""one of the world's major news agencies, supplying both text and images to newspapers, other news agencies, and radio and television broadcasters.""[2] Also at that point, it directly or through national news agencies provided service ""to most countries, reaching virtually all the world's leading newspapers and many thousands of smaller ones,"" according to Brittanica.[2]","In 1961, Reuters scooped news of the erection of the Berlin Wall.[5] Becoming one of the first news agencies to transmit financial data over oceans via computers in the 1960s,[2] in 1973 Reuters ""began making computer-terminal displays of foreign-exchange rates available to clients.""[2] In 1981, Reuters began making electronic transactions on its computer network, and afterwards developed a number of electronic brokerage and trading services.[2] Reuters was floated as a public company in 1984,[5] when Reuters Trust was listed on the stock exchanges[4] such as the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and NASDAQ.[2] Reuters published the first story of the Berlin Wall being breached in 1989.[5]","Share price grew during the dotcom boom, then fell after the banking troubles in 2001.[4] In 2002, Brittanica wrote that most news throughout the world came from three major agencies: the Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse.[6] Reuters merged with Thomson Corporation in Canada in 2008, forming Thomson Reuters.[2] In 2009, Thomson Reuters withdrew from the LSE and the NASDAQ, instead listing its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.[2] The last surviving member of the Reuters family founders, Marguerite, Baroness de Reuter, died at age 96 on 25 January 2009.[7] As of 2010, Reuters was headquartered in New York City, and provided financial information to clients while also maintaining its traditional news-agency business.[2]","In 2012, Thomson Reuters appointed Jim Smith as CEO.[1] Almost every major news outlet in the world subscribed to Reuters as of 2014. Reuters operated in more than 200 cities in 94 countries in about 20 languages as of 2014.[citation needed] In July 2016, Thomson Reuters agreed to sell its intellectual property and science operation for $3.55 billion to private equity firms.[8] In October 2016, Thomson Reuters announced expansions and relocations to Toronto.[8] As part of cuts and restructuring, in November 2016, Thomson Reuters Corp. eliminated 2,000 worldwide jobs out of its around 50,000 employees.[8]","The Reuters News Agency employs some 2,500 journalists and 600 photojournalists in about 200 locations worldwide. Reuters journalists use the Reuters Handbook of Journalism[9] as a guide for fair presentation and disclosure of relevant interests, to maintain the values of integrity and freedom upon which their reputation for reliability, accuracy, speed and exclusivity relies.[9]","In May 2000, Kurt Schork, an American reporter, was killed in an ambush while on assignment in Sierra Leone. In April and August 2003, news cameramen Taras Protsyuk and Mazen Dana were killed in separate incidents by U.S. troops in Iraq. In July 2007, Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh were killed when they were struck by fire from a U.S. military Apache helicopter in Baghdad.[10][11] During 2004, cameramen Adlan Khasanov in Chechnya and Dhia Najim in Iraq were also killed. In April 2008, cameraman Fadel Shana was killed in the Gaza Strip after being hit by an Israeli tank.[12]","The first Reuters journalist to be taken hostage[dubious – discuss] in action was Anthony Grey. Detained by the Chinese government while covering China's Cultural Revolution in Peking in the late 1960s, it was said to be in response to the jailing of several Chinese journalists by the colonial British government of Hong Kong.[13] He was considered to be the first political hostage of the modern age and was released after being imprisoned for 27 months from 1967 to 1969. Awarded an OBE by the British Government after his release, he went on to become a best-selling historical novelist.","In May 2016 the Ukrainian website Myrotvorets published the names and personal data of 4,508 journalists, including Reuters reporters, and other media staff from all over the world, who were accredited by the self-proclaimed authorities in the separatist-controlled regions of eastern Ukraine.[14]","Reuters has a policy of taking a ""value-neutral approach,"" which extends to not using the word ""terrorist"" in its stories, a practice which has attracted criticism following the September 11 attacks.[16] Reuters' editorial policy states: ""We are committed to reporting the facts and in all situations avoid the use of emotive terms. The only exception is when we are quoting someone directly or in indirect speech.""[17] (The Associated Press, by contrast, does use the term ""terrorist"" in reference to non-governmental organizations who carry out attacks on civilian populations.[16])","Following the September 11 attacks, Reuters global head of news Stephen Jukes reiterated the policy in an internal memo and later explained to media columnist Howard Kurtz (who criticized the policy): ""We all know that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, and that Reuters upholds the principle that we do not use the word terrorist...We're trying to treat everyone on a level playing field, however tragic it's been and however awful and cataclysmic for the American people and people around the world. We're there to tell the story. We're not there to evaluate the moral case.""[16]","In early October 2001, CEO Tom Glocer and editor-in-chief Geert Linnebank and Jukes later released a statement acknowledging that Jukes' memo ""had caused deep offence among members of our staff, our readers, and the public at large"" and wrote: ""Our policy is to avoid the use of emotional terms and not make value judgments concerning the facts we attempt to report accurately and fairly. We apologize for the insensitive manner in which we characterized this policy and extend our sympathy to all those who have been affected by these tragic events.""[18]","In September 2004, The New York Times reported that Reuters global managing editor, David A. Schlesinger objected to Canadian newspapers' editing of Reuters articles to insert the word terrorist. Schlesinger said: ""my goal is to protect our reporters and protect our editorial integrity.""[19]","In July 2013, David Fogarty, former Reuters climate change correspondent in Asia, resigned after a career of almost 20 years with the company and wrote about a ""climate of fear"" which resulted in ""progressively, getting any climate change-themed story published got harder"" following comments from then deputy editor-in-chief Paul Ingrassia that he was a ""climate change sceptic"". In his comments, Fogarty stated that ""Some desk editors happily subbed and pushed the button. Others agonised and asked a million questions. Debate on some story ideas generated endless bureaucracy by editors frightened to take a decision, reflecting a different type of climate within Reuters—the climate of fear,"" and that ""by mid-October, I was informed that climate change just wasn't a big story for the present. …Very soon after that conversation I was told my climate change role was abolished.""[20][21] Ingrassia, currently Reuters' managing editor, formerly worked for The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones for 31 years.[22] Reuters responded to Fogarty's piece by stating that ""Reuters has a number of staff dedicated to covering this story, including a team of specialist reporters at Point Carbon and a columnist. There has been no change in our editorial policy.""[23]","Subsequently, climate blogger Joe Romm cited a Reuters article on climate as employing ""false balance"", and quoted Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, Co-Chair of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute that ""[s]imply, a lot of unrelated climate skeptics nonsense has been added to this Reuters piece. In the words of the late Steve Schneider, this is like adding some nonsense from the Flat Earth Society to a report about the latest generation of telecommunication satellites. It is absurd."" Romm opined that ""We can't know for certain who insisted on cramming this absurd and non-germane 'climate sceptics nonsense' into the piece, but we have a strong clue. If it had been part of the reporter's original reporting, you would have expected direct quotes from actual skeptics, because that is journalism 101. The fact that the blather was all inserted without attribution suggests it was added at the insistence of an editor.""[24]","According to Ynetnews, Reuters was accused of bias against Israel in its coverage of the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict after the wire service used two doctored photos by a Lebanese freelance photographer, Adnan Hajj.[25] In August 2006, Reuters announced it had severed all ties with Hajj and said his photographs would be removed from its database.[26]","In 2010, Reuters was criticised again by Haaretz for ""anti-Israeli"" bias when it cropped the edges of photos, removing commandos' knives held by activists and a naval commando's blood from photographs taken aboard the Mavi Marmara during the Gaza flotilla raid, a raid that left nine Turkish activists dead. It has been alleged that in two separate photographs, knives held by the activists were cropped out of the versions of the pictures published by Reuters.[27] Reuters said it is standard operating procedure to crop photos at the margins, and replaced the cropped images with the original ones after it was brought to the agency's attention.[27]","In March 2015, the Brazilian affiliate of Reuters released a text containing an interview with Brazilian ex-president Fernando Henrique Cardoso about the ongoing Petrobrás scandal. One of the paragraphs mentioned a comment by a former Petrobrás manager, in which he suggests corruption in that company may date back to Cardoso's presidency. Attached to it, there was a comment between parenthesis: ""Podemos tirar se achar melhor"" (""we can take it out if [you] think it's better""),[28] which is now absent from the current version of the text.[29] The agency later issued a text in which they confirm the mistake, explaining it was a question by one of the Brazilian editors to the journalist who wrote the original text in English, and that it was not supposed to be published.[30]",Bibliography,"1

Leonardo_DiCaprio,"Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio (/dᵻˈkæpri.oʊ/; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor, film producer, and environmental activist.[1] DiCaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials in the early 1990s, after which he had recurring roles in various television series such as the soap opera Santa Barbara and the sitcom Growing Pains. He began his film career by starring as Josh in Critters 3 (1991). He starred in the film adaptation of the memoir This Boy's Life (1993), and was praised for his supporting role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He gained public recognition with leading roles in The Basketball Diaries (1995) and the romantic drama Romeo + Juliet (1996), before achieving international fame with James Cameron's epic romance Titanic (1997), which became the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's science fiction film Avatar (2009) overtook it.","Since 2000, DiCaprio has received critical acclaim for his work in a wide range of film genres. DiCaprio's subsequent films include The Man in the Iron Mask (1998), the biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can (2002), and the epic historical drama Gangs of New York (2002), which marked his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. He was acclaimed for his performances in the political war thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the neo-noir crime drama The Departed (2006), the espionage thriller Body of Lies (2008), the drama Revolutionary Road (2008), the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010), the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the biographical film J. Edgar (2011), the western Django Unchained (2012), and the period drama The Great Gatsby (2013).","DiCaprio's portrayals of Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and Hugh Glass in The Revenant (2015) won him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, and his role as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) won him the award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. He also won his first Academy Award and BAFTA Award for his performance in The Revenant. DiCaprio is the founder of his own production company, Appian Way Productions.",,,"Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles, California.[2] He is the only child of Irmelin (née Indenbirken), a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix artist and producer and distributor of comic books.[3] DiCaprio's father is of Italian (from Naples) and German (from Bavaria) descent.[4][5][6] DiCaprio's maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German.[7] His maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken (born Yelena Smirnova; 1915–2008),[8] was a Russian-born German citizen.[9][10] In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as ""half-Russian"" and said that two of his grandparents were Russian.[11] DiCaprio's parents met while attending college and subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California.[4]","DiCaprio was named Leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in a museum in Italy when he first kicked.[12] His parents separated when he was a year old, and he lived mostly with his mother.[13] The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz (his Los Feliz residence was later converted into a public library), while his mother worked several jobs.[4] DiCaprio attended Seeds Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a few blocks away, after attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years.[14] However, he dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (GED).[15][16] DiCaprio spent part of his childhood in Germany with his maternal grandparents, Wilhelm and Helene. He is conversant in German and Italian.[17][18][19]","DiCaprio's career began with his appearance in several commercials and educational films. After being removed from the set of children's television series Romper Room for being disruptive at the age of five,[20] he followed his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, landing an ad for Matchbox cars at 14.[20] In 1990, he got his break on television when he was cast in the short-lived series based on the movie Parenthood. After Parenthood, DiCaprio had bit parts on several shows, including The New Lassie and Roseanne, as well as a brief stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell. His involvement in Parenthood and the daily soap earned him a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor each.[21]","DiCaprio's debut film role was in the comedic sci-fi horror film Critters 3, in which he played the stepson of an evil landlord, a role that DiCaprio described as ""your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair.""[22] Released in 1991, the movie went direct-to-video.[22] Soon after, he became a recurring cast member on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver family. DiCaprio made his big screen breakthrough in 1992, when he was handpicked by Robert De Niro out of 400 young actors to play the lead role in This Boy's Life.[20]","Later in 1993, DiCaprio co-starred as the mentally handicapped brother of Johnny Depp's character in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, a comic-tragic odyssey of a dysfunctional Iowa family. Director Lasse Hallström admitted he was initially looking for a less good-looking actor but finally settled on DiCaprio as he had emerged as ""the most observant actor"" among all auditionees.[22] Budgeted at US$11 million,[23] the film became a critical success, resulting in various accolades for DiCaprio, who was awarded the National Board of Review Award and nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his portrayal. New York Times critic Janet Maslin praised DiCaprio's performance, writing ""the film's real show-stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio, who makes Arnie's many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. The performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end.""[24]","DiCaprio's first effort of 1995 was Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead, a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, and as a result, co-star Sharon Stone decided to pay the actor's salary herself.[25] The film was released to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics.[26] DiCaprio next starred in Total Eclipse, a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production on the project.[27] A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical run.[28]","DiCaprio appeared in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, as a favor to aspiring director R. D. Robb.[20] When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended to make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom.[20] The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics.[29] DiCaprio's last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biopic about Jim Carroll.[30]","In 1996, DiCaprio appeared opposite Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet, an abridged modernization of William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy of the same name, which retained the original Shakespearean dialogue. The project achieved a worldwide box office take of $147 million.[31]","Later that year, he starred in Jerry Zaks' family drama Marvin's Room, reuniting with Robert De Niro. Based on Scott McPherson's screenplay adaptation of his own 1991 stage play of the same name, the film revolves around two sisters, played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement.[32] DiCaprio portrayed Hank, Streep's character's troubled son, who has been committed to a mental asylum for setting fire to his mother's house.[33]","In 1997, DiCaprio starred in James Cameron's Titanic (1997) as twenty-year-old Jack Dawson, a penniless Wisconsin man who wins two tickets for the third-class on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. DiCaprio initially refused to portray the character but was eventually encouraged to pursue the role by Cameron, who strongly believed in his acting ability.[34] Against expectations, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film to date (it was surpassed in 2010 by Cameron's film Avatar), grossing more than $1.843 billion in box-office receipts worldwide,[35] and transformed DiCaprio into a commercial movie superstar, resulting in fan worship among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as ""Leo-Mania"".[36] In May 1998, for example, his face appeared on the covers of at least four teen magazines, and three books about DiCaprio were among the top six paperbacks on The New York Times Best Seller List.[37] More than 200 fans contacted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to protest his not being nominated for the 70th Academy Awards.[38] He was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a second Golden Globe nomination. Upon the success of Titanic, DiCaprio stated in 2000: ""I have no connection with me during that whole Titanic phenomenon and what my face became around the world [...] I'll never reach that state of popularity again, and I don't expect to. It's not something I'm going to try to achieve either.""[39]","The following year, DiCaprio made a self-mocking cameo appearance in Woody Allen's caustic satire of the fame industry, Celebrity (1998). That year, he also starred in the dual roles of the villainous King Louis XIV and his secret, sympathetic twin brother Philippe in Randall Wallace's The Man in the Iron Mask, based on the same-titled 1939 film. Despite receiving a rather mixed to negative response,[40] the film became a box office success, grossing US$180 million internationally.[41] Though DiCaprio's performance was generally well-received, with Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman writing that ""the shockingly androgynous DiCaprio looks barely old enough to be playing anyone with hormones, but he's a fluid and instinctive actor, with the face of a mischievous angel,""[42] he was awarded a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple for both incarnations the following year.[43]","DiCaprio's next project was the drama film The Beach (2000), an adaption of Alex Garland's 1996 novel of the same name. He played an American backpacking tourist looking for the perfect way of life in a secret island commune in the Gulf of Thailand. Budgeted at $US50 million, the film became a financial success, grossing $US144 million worldwide,[44] but as with DiCaprio's previous project, the film was largely panned by critics.[45] Todd McCarthy of Variety noted that ""Richard [DiCaprio's role] is too much the American Everyman and not enough of a well-defined individual to entirely capture one's interest and imagination, and DiCaprio, while perfectly watchable, does not endow him with the quirks or distinguishing marks to make this man from nowhere a dimensional character.""[46] The next year, he was nominated for another Razzie Award for his work on the film.","DiCaprio's first film of 2002 was the biographical crime drama film Catch Me If You Can, based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, used his charm, confidence, and several different personas, to make millions in the 1960s writing bad checks. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film was shot in 147 different locations in only 52 days, making it ""the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making"" DiCaprio had experienced yet.[47] Catch Me If You Can received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, becoming DiCaprio's highest-grossing film since Titanic with a total of US$351.1 million worldwide.[48] Roger Ebert praised his performance, and noted that while ""DiCaprio, who in recent films [...] has played dark and troubled characters, is breezy and charming here, playing a boy who discovers what he is good at, and does it.""[49] The following year, DiCaprio received his third Golden Globe nomination for his work in the film.[50]","Also in 2002, DiCaprio appeared in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project.[51] Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made.[51] Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success.[52] DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.[53][54]","Forging a collaboration with Scorsese, the two paired again for a biopic of the eccentric and obsessive American film director and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). Centering on Hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, DiCaprio initially developed the project with Michael Mann, who decided against directing it after back-to-back film biographies in Ali and The Insider.[54] The actor eventually pitched John Logan's script to Scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. The Aviator became a critical and financial success.[55] DiCaprio received rave reviews for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving another Academy Award nomination.[56][57]","In 2005, DiCaprio was made a commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture for his contributions to the arts.[58] The following year, the actor starred in both Blood Diamond and The Departed. In Edward Zwick's war film Blood Diamond, he starred as a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia who is involved in the Sierra Leone Civil War. The film itself received generally favorable reviews,[59] and DiCaprio was praised for the authenticity of his South African Afrikaner accent, known as a difficult accent to imitate.[60] In Scorsese's The Departed he played the role of Billy Costigan, a state trooper working undercover in an Irish Mob in Boston. Highly anticipated, the film was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews and became one of the highest-rated wide release films of 2006.[61] Budgeted at US$90 million, it also emerged as DiCaprio and Scorsese's highest-grossing collaboration to date, easily beating The Aviator´s previous record of US$213.7 million.[62] DiCaprio's performance in The Departed was applauded by critics and earned him a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor.[63] The same year, both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild nominated DiCaprio twice in the Best Actor category for both of his 2006 features, and in addition, DiCaprio earned his third Academy Award nomination for Blood Diamond.[64][65][66]","In 2008, DiCaprio starred in Body of Lies, a spy film based on the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, set in context of the Middle East and the War on Terror, telling the story of three men battling a terrorist organization, and each other.[67] Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975).[67] The film received mixed reviews from critics,[68] and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide.[69]","The same year, DiCaprio reunited with Kate Winslet to film the drama Revolutionary Road (2008), directed by Winslet's then-husband Sam Mendes. As both actors had been reluctant to make romantic films similar to Titanic, it was Winslet who suggested that both should work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates after reading the script by Justin Haythe, knowing that plot had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster.[70] Once DiCaprio agreed to do the film, it went almost immediately into production.[71] He noted that he saw his character as ""unheroic"" and ""slightly cowardly"" and that he was ""willing to be just a product of his environment.""[72] Portraying a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, DiCaprio and Winslet watched period videos promoting life in the suburbs to prepare themselves for Revolutionary Road, which eventually earned them favorable reviews.[73] For his portrayal DiCaprio garnered his seventh Golden Globes nomination.[74]","DiCaprio continued his collaborative streak with Scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film Shutter Island (2010), based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. He played U.S. Marshal Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility located on an island and comes to question his own sanity. The film grossed $294 million.[75]","Also in 2010, DiCaprio starred in director Christopher Nolan's science-fiction film Inception, also starring Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger and Michael Caine. Inspired by the experience of lucid dreaming and dream incubation,[76] DiCaprio portrays the character of Dom Cobb, an ""extractor"" who enters the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting an idea in a corporate target's mind.[77] DiCaprio was ""intrigued by this concept — this dream-heist notion and how this character's gonna unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life.""[78] Released to critical acclaim, the film grossed over $825 million worldwide.[79] To star in this film, DiCaprio agreed to a pay cut from his $20 million fee, in favor of splitting first-dollar gross points, which means he receives money coming directly off the top of ticket sales. This risk paid off, with DiCaprio earning $50 million from the film to become his highest payday yet.[80] In July 2010, it was announced that DiCaprio had pulled out of a Viking movie to be directed by Mel Gibson amid controversy over Gibson's rage-fueled rant tapes and domestic violence probe.[81]","In 2011, DiCaprio starred alongside Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts in Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar, a biopic about J. Edgar Hoover.[82] Written by Dustin Lance Black, the film focuses on the career of the FBI director from the Palmer Raids onwards, including an examination of his private life as an alleged closeted homosexual.[83] Reviews towards the film were mostly mixed, with many critics commending DiCaprio's performance but feeling that, overall, the film lacked coherence.[84] Roger Ebert praised DiCaprio's performance as a ""fully-realized, subtle and persuasive performance, hinting at more than Hoover ever revealed, perhaps even to himself.""[85]","In 2012, DiCaprio starred as villainous Calvin Candie in Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti western, Django Unchained.[86] While filming Django Unchained, DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand on glass, but continued filming despite the injury, and Tarantino elected to use the take in the final movie.[87] The film received positive reviews from critics[88] and earned DiCaprio his ninth nomination from the Golden Globes.[89] Django Unchained grossed $424 million worldwide.[90]","DiCaprio's next film was The Great Gatsby, again with Baz Luhrmann (who directed him in Romeo + Juliet in 1996), an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, also starring Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire; the film was released on May 10, 2013.[91][92] It received mixed reviews from critics,[93] however DiCaprio's portrayal as Jay Gatsby was praised. Critic Rafer Guzman of Newsday praised DiCaprio by stating, ""As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he is now the Gatsby to beat. Despite a borderline comedic entrance – haloed by fireworks and accompanied by Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue""—DiCaprio nails this maddeningly enigmatic character. He's as tough as Alan Ladd in '49, as suave as Redford in '74, but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. You hear it all in Gatsby's favorite phrase, ""old sport,"" a verbal tic that stumped other actors. It's a tremendous, hard-won performance.""[94] Matt Zoller Seitz of Roger Ebert.com described his performance as Gatsby as ""The movie's greatest and simplest special effect,"" and states ""This is an iconic performance — maybe his career best.""[95] The film grossed $348 million worldwide[96] and became Luhrmann's highest-grossing film.[97]","DiCaprio reunited with Scorsese for the fifth time in The Wolf of Wall Street, a film based on the life of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who was arrested in the late 1990s for securities fraud and money laundering.[98][99] Filming began on August 8, 2012, in New York,[100] and the film was released on December 25, 2013.[101] The role earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and his fourth Academy Award nomination for acting. In January 2013, DiCaprio said he was going to take a long break from acting and would ""fly around the world doing good for the environment.""[102]","In 2015, DiCaprio played fur trapper Hugh Glass in the survival drama The Revenant, directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu.[103] The film was well received by critics[104] and DiCaprio's performance garnered universal acclaim[105][106] that earned him numerous awards, including his first win at the Academy Awards in the Best Actor category,[107][108] his eleventh nomination and third win at Golden Globes in the Best Actor Drama category, and his first BAFTA award for Best Actor.[109]","On August 10, 2015, it was announced that Martin Scorsese will direct an adaptation of Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City, which will star DiCaprio with a screenplay to be written by Billy Ray.[110] In October 2015, Appian Way acquired the movie rights for a book about the Volkswagen emissions scandal.[111]","On October 21, 2016, it was announced that DiCaprio will portray Sam Phillips, founder of Memphis-based Sun Studio, in the forthcoming film based on Peter Guralnick's book Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock ‘N’ Roll.[112]","DiCaprio's romantic relationships have been widely covered in the media.[113] In 1997 DiCaprio dated the British singer Emma Bunton.[114][115] He also dated the actress Bijou Phillips[116] and the models Kristen Zang and Emma Miller.[117] In 2000, he met Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen, whom he dated until 2005.[118] He was romantically involved with Israeli model Bar Refaeli from 2005 to 2011, during which time he met with Israeli president Shimon Peres and visited Refaeli's hometown of Hod HaSharon.[119][120]","DiCaprio owns a home in Los Angeles, California and an apartment in Battery Park City, New York.[121] In 2009, he bought an island off mainland Belize, on which he is planning to create an eco-friendly resort.[122] In 2014, he purchased the original Dinah Shore residence designed by mid-century modern architect Donald Wexler in Palm Springs, California.[123]","In 2005, DiCaprio's face was severely injured when model Aretha Wilson hit him over the head with a broken bottle at a Hollywood party. After pleading guilty in 2010, Wilson was sentenced to prison for two years.[117]","During the 2004 presidential election, DiCaprio campaigned and donated to John Kerry's presidential bid. The FEC showed that DiCaprio gave $2,300 to Barack Obama's presidential campaign in the 2008 election, the maximum contribution an individual could give in that election cycle, and $5,000 to Obama's 2012 campaign.[124]",DiCaprio is agnostic.[125],"Following the success of Titanic in 1997 along with earlier films, 24-year-old DiCaprio established the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation in 1998, a non-profit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness.[126] Although concerned with all areas of the environment, it focuses on global warming, preserving Earth's biodiversity and supporting renewable energy. It has worked on projects in over 40 countries and has produced two short web documentaries, Water Planet and Global Warning.[127]","Because of his active involvement in those causes, he has received praise from environmental groups.[128] Among the accolades received were the Martin Litton Environment Award, in 2001, from Environment Now, and the Environmental Leadership Award in 2003 from Global Green USA.[129]","DiCaprio chaired the national Earth Day celebration in 2000, where he interviewed President Bill Clinton and they discussed plans to deal with global warming and the environment.[130] In 2007 he had a major role in The 11th Hour, a documentary about people's relationship to nature and global warming. He co-produced, co-wrote and narrated the film.[130] From a benefit ""11th Hour"" fine art auction he organized in 2013, he raised nearly $40 million to toward his foundation. He told attendees, ""Bid as if the fate of the planet depended on us.""[131] It became the world's highest-grossing environmental charity event ever held.[132] DiCaprio states that global warming is the world's ""number-one environmental challenge"".[133] In July 2016 his foundation awarded $15.6 million to help protect wildlife and the rights of Native Americans, along with combating climate change.[134]","He has been an active supporter of numerous environmental organizations and has sat on the board of the World Wildlife Fund, Global Green USA, International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Natural Resources Defense Council.[127][135] He traveled to Indonesia in early 2016 where he criticized the government's palm oil industry's slash-and-burn forest clearing methods.[136][137]","At the 2007 Oscar ceremony, DiCaprio and former Vice President Al Gore appeared to announce that the Academy Awards had incorporated environmentally intelligent practices in its production. He presented at the 2007 American leg of Live Earth, and in 2010 his environmental work earned DiCaprio a nomination for the VH1 Do Something Award, honoring people who do good.[138] In 2014 he was appointed as a United Nations representative on climate change, and later that year he made an opening statement to members of the UN Climate Summit.[139][140] He again spoke at the UN in April 2016 prior to the signing of Paris Climate Change Agreement.[141]","In 2015, DiCaprio executive produced a new Netflix-exclusive cut of Cowspiracy. The film explored the impact of animal agriculture on the environment and the positions of several environmental organizations on the issue.[142] He also executive-produced and appeared in Before the Flood, a 2016 documentary film examining various aspects of global warming.[143]","In accepting his Best Actor award at the 2016 Oscars ceremony, DiCaprio stated:","Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people out there who would be most affected by this. For our children’s children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed.[144]","DiCaprio has owned environment-friendly vehicles, including an electric Tesla Roadster,[145] a Fisker Karma plug-in hybrid,[146] and a Toyota Prius,[147] and his home is powered by solar panels[128] but his use of private jets and superyachts has attracted criticism by some sections of the media.[148][149][150] In 2016, during a vacation in Cannes, France, he made a one-day visit to New York City by private jet to collect an environmental award. Robert Rapier, an environmental analyst, said DiCaprio's lifestyle “diminishes his moral authority to lecture others on reducing their own carbon emissions. He demonstrates exactly why our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow. “It’s because everyone loves the combination of cost and convenience they offer. Alternatives usually require sacrifice of one form or another.”[151]","In November 2010, DiCaprio donated $1 million to the Wildlife Conservation Society at Russia's tiger summit. DiCaprio's persistence in reaching the event after encountering two plane delays caused then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to describe him as a ""muzhik"" or ""real man"".[152][153] In 2011, DiCaprio joined the Animal Legal Defense Fund's campaign to free Tony, a tiger who has spent the last decade at the Tiger Truck Stop in Grosse Tête, Louisiana.[154]","In early 2016, at a meeting with Pope Francis, he gave a charity donation and spoke about environmental issues. A few days later, possibly influenced by his meeting with DiCaprio, the Pope said he would act in a planned faith-based charity film, Beyond the Sun.

Profits from the film would be given to charities in Argentina.[155]","In April 2017, he promoted and protested President Trump's inaction on climate change by attending the 2017 People's Climate March.[156][157]","In 1998, DiCaprio and his mother donated $35,000 for a ""Leonardo DiCaprio Computer Center"" at the Los Feliz branch of the Los Angeles Public Library, the site of his childhood home.

Ricky_Martin,"Enrique Martín Morales (born December 24, 1971), commonly known as Ricky Martin, is a Puerto Rican singer, actor and author. Martin began his career at age twelve with the all-boy pop group Menudo. After five years with the group, he released several Spanish-language solo albums throughout the 1990s. He also acted on stage and on TV in Mexico, becoming a modest star in the country. In 1994 he starred on the American TV soap opera General Hospital, playing a Puerto Rican singer.","In early 1999, after releasing several albums in Spanish, Martin performed ""The Cup of Life"" at the 41st Grammy Awards show, which became a catalyst in bringing Latin pop to the forefront of the U.S. music scene.[1] Following its success, Martin released ""Livin' la Vida Loca"" which helped him obtain enormous success worldwide and is generally seen as the song that began the Latin pop explosion of 1999 and made the transition easier for other Spanish-speaking artists to move into the English-speaking market. Since its release, the song has sold over 8 million copies, making it one of the best selling singles of all time.[2] His first English-language album (also titled Ricky Martin), has sold 22 million copies and is one of the best selling albums of all time.[3][4][5] His other studio albums include: Me Amarás (1993), A Medio Vivir (1995), Vuelve (1998), Sound Loaded (2000), Almas del Silencio (2003), Life (2005), Música + Alma + Sexo (2011), and A Quien Quiera Escuchar (2015).",,,"Martin was born on December 24, 1971, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the son of Nereida Morales, an accountant, and Enrique Martín Negroni, a psychologist.[6][7][8][9] He was the second youngest sibling. His parents divorced when he was two years old and Martin spent much of his childhood shifting between his father's home in the suburbs of University Gardens, a suburban middle-class neighborhood of San Juan, and his paternal grandmother's house nearby.[10][11] Martin has two older maternal half-brothers, Fernando and Ángel Fernández, and two older paternal half-brothers, Eric and Daniel Martín, and a younger paternal half-sister Vanessa Martín.[8] Martin in an interview with Vanity Fair described his origins as Spanish, with Basque and Jewish ancestry from his great-grandparents, plus some Corsican through his paternal grandmother.[12][13][14][15]","Martin grew up in a Roman Catholic home and was an altar boy throughout his childhood.[16] He began singing at age six, using wooden kitchen spoons as pretend microphones; he often interpreted songs by Menudo as well as English-language rock groups such as Led Zeppelin, Journey, and REO Speedwagon.[17] His mother's side of the family was musically inclined and his maternal grandfather was a poet, which inspired young Martin to write songs.[17] Martin later reflected on his time spent with his family as a child: ""Every time I find myself in front of an audience, be it twenty people or one hundred thousand, once again I feel the energy that consumed me back at the family gatherings of my youth.""[18] After discovering a newspaper advertisement about auditions for commercials with his father, nine-year-old Martin began appearing in Puerto Rican television commercials for products such as soft drinks, toothpaste, and fast-food restaurants.[19] In a year and a half, he starred in eleven commercials.[19]","After achieving a small amount of fame in Puerto Rico for his work in television commercials, Martin auditioned for membership in Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. Although the executives enjoyed his dancing and singing at his first two auditions, Martin was rejected because he was too short.[21] By the third audition, his persistence impressed executives and in 1984, twelve-year-old Martin became a member.[22] A month after joining Menudo, he made his debut performance with the group at the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center in San Juan.[23] During this performance, he inadvertently disobeyed the choreography by walking around the stage when it was planned that he would stay still, and was chastised by the band manager after the show: ""The mistake was such a big deal that from that moment on, never again did I move when I wasn't supposed to move...That was the discipline of Menudo: You either did things the way you were told or you were not part of the group.""[24] The song ""Asignatura Pendiente"" from Almas del Silencio (2003) was inspired by the first time Martin left Puerto Rico to tour with Menudo.[25]","Although Martin enjoyed traveling and performing onstage with Menudo, he found the band's busy schedule and strict managing to be exhausting and later reflected that the experience ""cost"" him his childhood.[26] He considered leaving the group while on tour in Brazil, but ultimately decided to stay out of fear of media backlash and being sued for breach of contract.[27] Martin also began struggling with his sexuality, noting the stark contrast between his status as a sex symbol and his own emotions.[28] Despite this, Martin acknowledged his ""opportunity to have so many amazing experiences with so many amazing people"" during his time with the group.[29] He developed an interest in philanthropy when the group became UNICEF ambassadors, often working with impoverished children in third world countries.[29] His experiences as an ambassador affected him greatly and inspired him to continue working with charities later in life.[29] By 1987, Menudo's record sales began to decline and the group changed its image, adopting an edgier look and performing more rock-influenced songs.[30] The band released the album Somos Los Hijos del Rock in Spanish, and to appeal to the Menudo's Filipino fanbase, the group released In Action, recording songs in both English and Tagalog.[30]","After recording eleven albums with the group, Martin left Menudo in July 1989 at age seventeen, hoping to rest and evaluate his career path.[31] He performed his final show with the group at the same venue as his first performance as a member.[31] Martin returned to Puerto Rico to graduate from high school, and thirteen days after turning eighteen, he moved to New York City to celebrate his financial independence; since he was a minor during his time as a member of Menudo, Martin was not allowed to access his own bank accounts.[32] He was accepted into New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but months before classes began, Martin dropped out and moved to Mexico City to perform in the play Mama Ama el Rock (Mom Loves Rock).[33]","While he was performing in onstage in Mama Ama el Rock, a producer in the audience took notice of Martin's acting and offered him a role in the Mexican telenovela Alcanzar una estrella after the show.[34] He also joined the cast for the second season of the show, titled Alcanzar una estrella II.[34] A film based on the TV series entitled Más que alcanzar una estrella was also produced in which Martin starred and earned an El Heraldo Award in 1993 for his role.[35] The show centered around a fictional musical group called Muñecos de Papel in which Martin played Pablo Loredo, one of the six members; the group toured several cities in Mexico and recorded two albums.[34] Although he had hoped to take a break from touring after Menudo, Martin enjoyed the experience because he got along with the other members well.[35]","I was so excited about getting back into the music world that I didn't care what the conditions were...All of the hard work and passion I had exerted was finally now starting to come to fruition, and music came back to my life powerfully and definitively.","In 1990, Martin was signed to Sony Discos, the Sony Music Entertainment's Latin imprint. Eager to make his first solo album, Martin signed the contract without reading it and inadvertently signed a deal in which he would only be awarded one cent of royalties for each album sold.[36] Despite viewing the contract as unfair, Martin referred to the record as ""the start of something phenomenal"" for him.[36] After working ""around the clock"" to finish filming Alcanzar una estrella II and recording music, Martin released his debut solo album, the Spanish-language Ricky Martin, in November 1991.[37] Ricky Martin included the singles: ""Fuego Contra Fuego"" and ""El Amor de Mi Vida"". ""Fuego Contra Fuego"" was certified Gold in Mexico, Argentina, Puerto Rico, and the United States.[38] To promote the album, Martin toured throughout Latin America, which the singer referred to as ""an indescribable feeling, almost like coming home.""[38]","After the success of Ricky Martin and its subsequent tour, Martin's record company met him with acclaimed producer Juan Carlos Calderón on his second solo album, Me Amarás. Although Martin felt ""very grateful"" for the opportunity to work with Calderón, he noted, ""I always felt that that record was more his than mine.""[39] Released in May 1993, Me Amarás features a Spanish-language cover of the Laura Branigan song ""Self Control"", titled ""Que Dia Es Hoy"".[40] In his review, Alex Henderson of AllMusic wrote, ""The CD isn't without its pleasures...but on the whole, Me Amarás is too glossy, too calculated, and much too contrived for its own good.""[40]","In 1994, Martin's agent encouraged him to move to Los Angeles to act in an American sitcom called Getting By.[41] The show was canceled after two seasons, but soon after, Martin was given the role of singer/bartender Miguel Morez on the soap opera General Hospital.[42] Martin felt that he lacked chemistry with the rest of the General Hospital cast, and observed that people treated him differently because of his Puerto Rican accent.[43] At the time, it was relatively uncommon for Hispanic people to appear on American television, and people suggested that he take accent reduction classes, which he refused.[42] It was during this time, however, that Martin began his first committed relationship with a man.[44] He ""stopped fearing his sexuality"", and soon came out to his mother, who was supportive of him.[44] However, after the relationship ended, Martin ""locked [his] feelings even deeper inside"", and began dating women again.[45] He recalled, ""I already felt it was hard to be a Latino in Hollywood; what could have been more difficult than being Latino and gay?""[46]","In 1995, Martin refocused on his music career, and began work on his third album, A Medio Vivir. The first single, the ballad ""Te Extraño, Te Olvido, Te Amo"", written by the producer of Lynda Thomas, Carlos Lara, was reminiscent of his earlier work.[47] With the song, Martin furthered his expansion from Latin American and Spanish-speaking audiences to the European and Asian markets.[48] However, the record also made a shift from his traditional ballad-style compositions to a more risky fusion of music centered around traditional Latin sounds, epitomized by the song ""Maria"". Taken aback by the starkly different musical style, record label executives felt that the song would ruin Martin's career.[49] Despite this, ""Maria"" was chosen as the album's second single, and became a breakthrough hit, reaching number one in France, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Finland, Italy, Turkey, and the entire continent of South America.[49] With A Medio Vivir, Martin was credited, along with singers Chayanne and Marc Anthony, for popularizing the music of Puerto Rico in Spain.[50] The album has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.","In a 1996 interview with The Miami Herald, Martin expressed an interest in performing on Broadway. Days after the interview was released Martin received a phone call from producer Richard Jay-Alexander, offering him the role of Marius Pontmercy in the play Les Misérables.[51] After the conclusion of a worldwide tour in support of A Medio Vivir, Martin returned to New York to appear in the play in an eleven-week run.[52] He greatly enjoyed the experience, calling his time in the play an ""honor"" and ""the role of [his] life"".[52] Martin continued to tour after the conclusion of the show's run, and noted that his audiences were growing in both size and enthusiasm.[53] In 1997, Martin was invited to the prestigious Sanremo Music Festival in Sanremo, Italy. After landing in Milan, Martin's scheduled helicopter trip to Sanremo had to be postponed due to poor weather conditions.[54] Hoping to arrive at the festival on time, Martin and his crew drove through the mountainous terrain at over 120 miles per hour. The car then turned too quickly and flipped over.[54] However, ""none of us had more than a couple of scratches and bruises"" and he arrived at the festival on time by taxi later that day.[54] In the summer of 1997, Martin embarked on a tour of Spain, performing 45 shows in 36 cities.[55]","While on tour, Martin returned to the studio to record his fourth album, Vuelve (1998). He called the experience of touring and recording at the same time ""brutal and incredibly intense"".[56] As he was finishing the record, the singer was contacted by FIFA to write a song for the 1998 World Cup; Martin subsequently wrote ""La copa de la vida"" with K. C. Porter and Draco Rosa.[57] He performed the song at the World Cup final in the Stade de France on July 12, 1998.[58] The performance, which was broadcast to over a billion viewers in 187 countries, was described as a ""global moment for Latin pop"".[59] ""La copa de la vida"" reached No. 1 on the charts around the world and went gold and platinum in various countries. It was awarded Pop Song of the Year at the 1999 Lo Nuestro Awards.[60] The title track and the ballad ""Perdido Sin Tí"" both hit number one on the Hot Latin Songs. Further singles included: ""La Bomba"", ""Por Arriba, Por Abajo"" and ""Corazonado"". Vuelve spent twenty-six weeks at number one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums. It became Martin's first top forty album on the Billboard 200 in the United States, where it was certified platinum by the RIAA. The album also went to number one in Spain and Norway, and sold over eight million copies worldwide.[61]","Martin was nominated for his first Grammy Award for Vuelve in the category of Best Latin Pop Album, and was booked to sing on the 41st Grammy Awards live TV broadcast. His acclaimed performance of ""La copa de la vida"" earned Martin an unexpected standing ovation and introduced him to the mainstream American audience. Being aware of performing on the Grammy, he said that:""The excitement is more than being nominated for the award. The audience in front of me are people who are hard to please. Sting! Madonna! Luciano Pavarotti! To get the acceptance of your peers really means a lot.""[62][63] Martin won the Grammy Award later that evening, and even superstars Madonna and Sting went backstage to congratulate him.[64] His appearance sparked nationwide interest in Latin music. Writing for Billboard on April 24, 1999, Michael Paoletta noted, ""In the weeks since [the performance], it seems like every record label exec has been in a heated search for the next Latin hottie.""[65]","After receiving commercial success throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America, Martin prepared his first English album in 1999 in an attempt to cross over to the United States market.[66] The self-titled album, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 661,000 copies in its first week of release, became the most successful album debut on the Billboard charts by a Hispanic artist.[67] It contained material by writers and producers such as Desmond Child, Diane Warren, William Orbit, George Noriega and his longtime childhood friend Draco Rosa. The album also featured special guests: Madonna on the Spanish-English duet ""Be Careful (Cuidado con mi Corazón)"" and Meja on ""Private Emotion"".[68] Two weeks after the album's release, Martin was featured on the cover of Time with the title ""Latin Music Goes Pop!"".[69] Before the album's release, Janet Jackson collaborated with Ricky Martin for the Latin American version of ""Ask for More"", a promotional single and commercial released as part of an advertising campaign for soft drink company Pepsi.[70][71]","The first and most prominent single was ""Livin' la Vida Loca"", which reached number one in many countries around the world, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. ""Livin' la Vida Loca"" is Ricky Martin's biggest hit. The video for ""Livin 'La Vida Loca"" was directed by Wayne Isham and starring model Nina Moric. It was followed by ""She's All I Ever Had"" which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Both tracks peaked at number one on the Hot Latin Songs. ""Livin' la Vida Loca"" is generally seen as the song that began the Latin pop explosion of 1999 and made the transition of other Latin artists (first Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias, then later Shakira) into the English-speaking market easier. Ricky Martin became one of the top-selling albums of 1999, and was certified 7× platinum in the United States, selling over 22 million copies worldwide. In October 1999, Martin embarked on a very successful year-long Livin' la Vida Loca Tour.","After this success, a new English-language album, Sound Loaded, was released in November 2000. It debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA. ""She Bangs"" and ""Nobody Wants to Be Lonely"" (duet with Christina Aguilera) peaked at number twelve and thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. Both singles reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs. Sound Loaded has sold over 8 million copies worldwide.","In February 2001, Martin released a Spanish greatest hits album entitled La Historia, which went to number one for five weeks on the Billboard Top Latin Albums and debuted at number eighty-three on the Billboard 200.

Chopra played a double role, so she coloured her hair twice; once red to portray the girl from the future and then black for the girl of the past.[71] Her performance was poorly received; Rajeev Masand was unimpressed with Chopra's chemistry with her co-star, remarking that her character ""fails to inspire either affection or sympathy"".[72] She next appeared in the comedy God Tussi Great Ho, portraying a TV anchor opposite Salman Khan, Sohail Khan and Amitabh Bachchan. The film was generally perceived to be plagiarised from the Hollywood comedy Bruce Almighty,[73][74] although writer and director Rumi Jaffrey claimed it to be ""a village folk tale about a Brahmin"".[75] Chopra next starred as a kindergarten teacher in Chamku opposite Bobby Deol and Irrfan Khan, and played the role of Sonia in Goldie Behl's fantasy superhero film Drona opposite Abhishek Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan. Drona, widely criticised for its extensive use of special effects, marked Chopra's sixth film in succession which had failed at both the box-office and critically, although Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra displayed convincing action heroine skills.[65][76] Critics generally perceived at this time that her career was over.[65]","The string of poorly received films ended when Chopra starred in Madhur Bhandarkar's Fashion, a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed the lives and careers of several fashion models. She portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months' consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar's confidence in her.[77] For the role, Chopra had to gain 6 kilograms (13 lb) and steadily shed the weight during the production as the character progressed in the film. Both the film and her performance received critical acclaim, becoming a major turning point in her career.[49] Rajeev Masand wrote, ""Priyanka Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best.""[78] For her performance, she won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Actress, the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, the IIFA Award for Best Actress, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[47][79][80] With a worldwide revenue of ₹600 million (US$9 million), Fashion emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha as one of the best films of the decade with women protagonists.[81][82] It was noted for being commercially successful despite being a women-centric film with no male lead.[83] She said in retrospect, ""I think actually Fashion kick started ... the process of female dominated films. Today you have so many other films which have done well with female leads.""[24]","Chopra's final film of the year was Tarun Mansukhani's romantic comedy Dostana, with Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham. Set in Miami, the film tells the story of a friendship between her character and two men who pretend to be gay to share an apartment with her. Chopra played a stylish young fashion-magazine editor Neha, who is trying to deal with professional pressures in her life. Produced by Dharma Productions, the film was a financial success with worldwide revenues of over ₹860 million (US$13 million).[50] Chopra's performance and look in the film were praised.[84][85]","The following year Chopra played a feisty Marathi woman named Sweety in Vishal Bhardwaj's caper thriller Kaminey (co-starring Shahid Kapoor), about twin brothers and the journey in their life linked with the underworld. The film received critical acclaim and became successful at the box-office with the worldwide gross earnings of ₹710 million (US$11 million).[50][84] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India thought that Chopra's role completely reinvented her, and Rajeev Masand wrote: ""Springing a delightful surprise in a smaller part is [Chopra], who sprinkles her lines with a smattering of fluent Marathi and emerges one of the film's most lovable characters.""[86][87] Raja Sen of Rediff.com named Chopra's performance as the best by an actress that year.[88] Her role earned her several awards and nominations, including a second consecutive Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role after Fashion and Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen and IIFA awards.[89][90] Chopra subsequently appeared in Ashutosh Gowariker's romantic comedy What's Your Raashee?, based on the novel Kimball Ravenswood by Madhu Rye. The film depicts the story of a US-based Gujrati NRI in search of his soulmate among 12 girls (all played by Chopra) associated with the 12 zodiac signs. She received the Screen Best Actress Award nomination for her performance in the film.[91] She was also considered for inclusion in the Guinness World Records book for being the first film actress to portray 12 distinct characters in one film.[92] Chopra's heavy workload—filming for several productions, travelling for endorsements and performing at live shows (including the Miss India pageant)—took its toll; she fainted during filming, and was admitted to hospital.[93]","In 2010, Chopra starred with Uday Chopra in Jugal Hansraj's unremarkable romantic comedy Pyaar Impossible! as Alisha, a beautiful college girl (and later a working mother) who falls in love with a nerdy boy. Later that year, she co-starred with Ranbir Kapoor in Siddharth Anand's romantic comedy Anjaana Anjaani. The film, set in New York and Las Vegas, follows the story of two strangers, both trying to commit suicide, who eventually fall in love with each other. The film was a moderate commercial success,[94] and her performance received mixed reviews from critics. Sarita Tanwar of Mid Day wrote, ""Priyanka Chopra is at her casual and spontaneous best. She embraces the character completely and makes it totally believable"",[95] while Anupama Chopra dismissed her acting as ""artificial"".[96]","She starred as a femme fatale in her first film of 2011, Vishal Bhardwaj's black comedy 7 Khoon Maaf. Based on the short story ""Susanna's Seven Husbands"" by Ruskin Bond, 7 Khoon Maaf centres on Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes, an Anglo-Indian woman (played by Chopra) who murders her seven husbands in an unending quest for love. The film and her performance received acclaim from critics. Nikhat Kazmi remarked, ""7 Khoon Maaf would undoubtedly end up as a milestone in Priyanka Chopra's career graph. The actor displays exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema.""[97] Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis wrote: ""Priyanka Chopra takes on a character that most of her contemporaries would shy away from and enacts it in a way that only she possibly can. For a woman with as many shades as Susanna, Chopra gets a crack at a role of a lifetime and she sparkles like never before.""[98] Chopra's performance earned her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, the IIFA Award for Best Actress, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[99]","Chopra's final release of the year saw her reprising her role as Roma in the second installment of the Don franchise, Don 2. Although the film received mixed reviews,[100] Chopra's performance earned positive feedback from critics. According to The Express Tribune, ""Chopra ... seems to be the perfect choice for an action heroine. As you watch her effortlessly beat up some thugs in the movie, you come to the realisation that she may be the first proper female action hero in Bollywood.""[101] Don 2 was a major success in India and overseas, earning over ₹2.06 billion (US$32 million) worldwide.[102][103] Don 2 was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival[104] and (with Don) at the 2012 International Film Festival of Marrakech, in Morocco.[105]","Chopra's first film of 2012 was Karan Malhotra's action drama Agneepath, in which she starred with Hrithik Roshan, Sanjay Dutt and Rishi Kapoor. Produced by Karan Johar, the film is a remake of his father's 1990 production of the same name. In one of several accidents to happen during production, Chopra's lehenga (a traditional skirt) caught fire while filming a sequence for an elaborate Ganpati festival song.[106] She featured as Kaali Gawde, Roshan's loquacious love interest in the film. Mayank Shekhar noted how much Chopra stood out in the male-dominated film.[107] Agneepath broke Bollywood's highest opening-day earnings record, and had a worldwide gross of ₹1.93 billion (US$30 million).[102][108] Chopra next co-starred with Shahid Kapoor in Kunal Kohli's romance, Teri Meri Kahaani. The film relates the stories of three unconnected couples (each played by Kapoor and Chopra), born in different eras. The film opened to mixed reactions from critics, but Chopra's performance was generally well received.[109]","Anurag Basu's Barfi!, with Ranbir Kapoor and Ileana D'Cruz, was her final appearance of 2012. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of three people, two of whom are physically disabled. Chopra played Jhilmil Chatterjee, an autistic woman who falls in love with a deaf, mute man (Kapoor). Rituparno Ghosh, an acclaimed director, considered it a ""very, very brave"" role to accept given how demanding it is for an actor to convincingly portray a woman with autism.[110] To prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic people.[111] The film received rave reviews from film critics[110][112] and was a major commercial success, earning ₹1.75 billion (US$27 million) worldwide.[113] Chopra received unanimous praise for her portrayal, which several reviewers regarded as her best performance at that time.[114] The Indo-Asian News Service review said, ""Priyanka Chopra as the autistic Jhilmil steals the show from Ranbir, if that's possible. Her inherent glamorous personality simply disappears into her character. We don't see the actress on screen at all! We see only Jhilmil who reminds us in a very pleasant way of Sridevi in Sadma. This is one of the most flawless interpretations of a physical-psychological disability seen on celluloid.""[115] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph noted Ranbir and Priyanka turn in two of the finest performances seen on the Indian screen.[116] Chopra received Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen, IIFA and Producers Guild Film Awards.[99] The film was screened at the Busan[117] and Marrakech International Film Festivals,[105] and was chosen as India's entry for the 85th Academy Awards.[118] Don 2, Agneepath and Barfi! rank among the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time.[102]","In 2013, she lent her voice to the character of Ishani, the reigning Pan-Asian champion from India and the love interest of the main protagonist in the Disney Animation Studios's film Planes, a spinoff of Pixar's Cars franchise. Chopra, a fan of Disney films, had fun voicing the character saying ""The closest I could come to being a Disney princess, I think, was Ishani"".[119] The film was a commercial success, grossing approximately US$240 million worldwide.[120] She played an NRI girl in the Apoorva Lakhia's bilingual action drama Zanjeer (Thoofan in Telugu), a remake of the 1973 Hindi film of the same name, which met with poor reactions from critics and was unsuccessful at the box office.[121][122] Chopra next reprised her role of Priya in Rakesh Roshan's Krrish 3—a sequel to the 2006 superhero film Krrish—with Hrithik Roshan, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. The film earned positive reviews though critics opined that Chopra's role in the film was small. Writing for Daily News and Analysis, Sarita A Tanwar commented that ""Priyanka is saddled with a role that doesn't do her justice. She deserved a meatier role.""[123] The feature became a box office success, earning over ₹3 billion (US$47 million) worldwide, to become Chopra's biggest commercial success till date and her fourth major hit in the last two years.[124][125] She also appeared in an item number titled ""Ram Chahe Leela"" for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela. The song, which took four days to rehearse, saw Chopra execute a contemporary mujra, that incorporated complicated dance steps.[126]","In 2014, Chopra played the lead female role in Yash Raj Films's romantic action drama Gunday directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, alongside Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. She portrayed Nandita, a cabaret dancer in Calcutta. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of two best friends, who fall in love with Chopra's character. Gunday proved to be a box-office success, grossing over ₹1 billion (US$16 million) worldwide.[127] She next featured in Mary Kom, a biographical film of the five time world boxing champion and Olympic bronze medalist Mary Kom.[128] To prepare for the role, she spent time with Kom and received four months of boxing training.[129] The film premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, received positive reviews from critics, and her performance received critical acclaim.[130][131] Namrata Joshi from Outlook felt that Chopra's sincere and earnest performance brings out Kom's ""determination as well as her vulnerabilities, and insecurities"", and Indo-Asian News Service wrote ""Priyanka expresses every shade of her character with a pitch-perfect bravado. The actress controls curbs and quantifies every component of her character's personality without losing that basic element of spontaneity.""[132][133] Mary Kom emerged as a major commercial success, with revenues of ₹1.04 billion (US$16 million) at the box-office.[134][135] Chopra won the Screen Award for Best Actress, the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and received another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.[136][137]","The following year, Chopra starred in Zoya Akhtar's Dil Dhadakne Do, an ensemble comedy-drama alongside Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Ranveer Singh, Anushka Sharma and Farhan Akhtar.

She portrayed the role of Ayesha Mehra, a successful entrepreneur and the eldest child. Both the film and her performance attracted positive reviews. Pratim D. Gupta from The Telegraph considered Chopra to be one of the winners of the film and wrote ""From the propah body language to the measured speech [...] shows the kind of depth she is able to bring to her lines and characters these days.[138] Rajiv Vijayakar of India-West wrote, ""Topping the [ensemble cast] is the nuanced, magnificent work of Priyanka Chopra as Ayesha. Her tiny expressions and nuances, as well as her vocal inflections truly bring her character alive.""[139] The cast of Dil Dhadakne Do won the Screen Award for Best Ensemble Cast, and Chopra was nominated for a Screen Award, IIFA Award, and Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress.[140][141]","Chopra signed a talent holding deal with ABC Studios and was later cast in the American thriller series Quantico as the character Alex Parrish.[142][143][144] The series premiered on 27 September 2015 on ABC, making Chopra the first South Asian to headline an American network series.[145] The series received positive reviews from television critics and Chopra was praised for her performance.[146][147] James Poniewozik of The New York Times described Chopra as the ""strongest human asset"" of the show, and added that ""she is immediately charismatic and commanding.""[148] She received the People's Choice Award for ""Favourite Actress In A New TV Series"" for her role in Quantico, becoming the first South Asian actress to win a People's Choice Award.[149] The following year, Chopra won a second People's Choice Award for ""Favorite Dramatic TV Actress"".[150]","Chopra next portrayed Kashibai, the first wife of the maratha general Peshwa Bajirao I, in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's epic historical romance drama Bajirao Mastani.

Jha labelled her ""the best actress in the post-Sridevi generation"" and listed her character in Barfi! as being ""one of the finest inwardly ravaged characters in Bollywood.""[249] Chopra has often featured on Rediff.com's annual listing of ""Bollywood's Best Actresses"", and was featured in their list of ""Top 10 Actresses of 2000–2010"".[88][250][251][252][253]","Chopra is one of the highest-paid and most popular and high-profile celebrities in India.[3][254][255] She is described as a sex symbol and a style icon.[256] Her figure, eyes, lips and exotic looks have been cited by the media as her distinctive physical features.[257][258][259] Designers Falguni and Shane Peacock wrote, ""She is comfortable in her own skin and looks ravishing in whatever she wears, be it a bikini, short or long dress or even a sari.""[260] She ranks high on lists of the most beautiful, influential, powerful, and attractive celebrities in the World.

National_Geographic_(magazine),"National Geographic is the official magazine of the National Geographic Society. It has been published continuously since its first issue in 1888, nine months after the Society itself was founded. It primarily contains articles about science, geography, history, and world culture. The magazine is known for its thick square-bound glossy format with a yellow rectangular border and its extensive use of dramatic photographs.","The magazine is published monthly, and additional map supplements are also included with subscriptions. It is available in a traditional printed edition and through an interactive online edition. On occasion, special editions of the magazine are issued. As of 2015, the magazine was circulated worldwide in nearly 40 local-language editions and had a global circulation of approximately 6.5 million per month according to data published by The Washington Post (down from about 12 million in the late 1980s) or 6.5 million according to National Geographic. This includes a US circulation of 3.5 million.[6][7] From the 1970s through about 2010 the magazine was printed in Corinth, Mississippi, by private printers until that plant was finally closed.","On September 9, 2015, the National Geographic Society announced a deal with 21st Century Fox that would move the magazine to a new partnership, National Geographic Partners, in which 21st Century Fox would hold a 73 percent controlling interest.[8]",,,"The current Editor-in-Chief of the National Geographic Magazine is Susan Goldberg.[1] Goldberg is also Editorial Director for National Geographic Partners, overseeing the print and digital expression of National Geographic’s editorial content across its media platforms. She is responsible for News, Books (with the exception of National Geographic Kids books), National Geographic Traveler magazine, National Geographic History magazine, Maps, and all digital content with the exception of National Geographic Kids. Goldberg reports to Declan Moore, CEO of National Geographic Partners.","The first issue of National Geographic Magazine was published on September 22, 1888, nine months after the Society was founded. Starting with its January 1905 publication of several full-page pictures of Tibet in 1900–1901, the magazine changed from being a text-oriented publication closer to a scientific journal to featuring extensive pictorial content, and became well known for this style. The June 1985 cover portrait of the presumed to be 12-year-old Afghan girl Sharbat Gula, shot by photographer Steve McCurry, became one of the magazine's most recognizable images.","In the late 1990s, the magazine began publishing The Complete National Geographic, a digital compilation of all the past issues of the magazine. It was then sued over copyright of the magazine as a collective work in Greenberg v. National Geographic and other cases, and temporarily withdrew the availability of the compilation. The magazine eventually prevailed in the dispute, and in July 2009 it resumed publishing a compilation containing all issues through December 2008. The compilation was later updated to make more recent issues available, and the archive and digital edition of the magazine are available online to the magazine's subscribers.","National Geographic Kids, the children's version of the magazine, was launched in 1975 under the name National Geographic World.",The January 2017 issue of National Geographic has a nine-year-old transgender girl on the cover (Avery Jackson); she is thought to be the first openly transgender person on National Geographic’s cover.[9][10],[11] [12],"During the Cold War, the magazine committed itself to presenting a balanced view of the physical and human geography of nations beyond the Iron Curtain. The magazine printed articles on Berlin, de-occupied Austria, the Soviet Union, and Communist China that deliberately downplayed politics to focus on culture. In its coverage of the Space Race, National Geographic focused on the scientific achievement while largely avoiding reference to the race's connection to nuclear arms buildup. There were also many articles in the 1930s, 40s and 50s about the individual states and their resources, along with supplement maps of each state. Many of these articles were written by longtime staff such as Frederick Simpich.[13] There were also articles about biology and science topics.","In later years, articles became outspoken on issues such as environmental issues, deforestation, chemical pollution, global warming, and endangered species. Series of articles were included focusing on the history and varied uses of specific products such as a single metal, gem, food crop, or agricultural product, or an archaeological discovery. Occasionally an entire month's issue would be devoted to a single country, past civilization, a natural resource whose future is endangered, or other theme. In recent decades, the National Geographic Society has unveiled other magazines with different focuses. Whereas in the past, the magazine featured lengthy expositions, recent issues have shorter articles.","In addition to being well known for articles about scenery, history, and the most distant corners of the world, the magazine has been recognized for its book-like quality and its standard of photography. It was during the tenure of Society President Alexander Graham Bell and editor Gilbert H. Grosvenor (GHG) that the significance of illustration was first emphasized, in spite of criticism from some of the Board of Managers who considered the many illustrations an indicator of an “unscientific” conception of geography. By 1910, photographs had become the magazine’s trademark and Grosvenor was constantly on the search for ""dynamical pictures"" as Graham Bell called them, particularly those that provided a sense of motion in a still image. In 1915, GHG began building the group of staff photographers and providing them with advanced tools including the latest darkroom.[14]","The magazine began to feature some pages of color photography in the early 1930s, when this technology was still in its early development. During the mid-1930s, Luis Marden (1913–2003), a writer and photographer for National Geographic, convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use the so-called ""miniature"" 35 mm Leica cameras loaded with Kodachrome film over bulkier cameras with heavy glass plates that required the use of tripods.[15] In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs. National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, to allow for a full page photograph taken for one of the month's articles. Issues of National Geographic are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles. The standard for photography has remained high over the subsequent decades and the magazine is still illustrated with some of the highest-quality photojournalism in the world.[16] In 2006, National Geographic began an international photography competition with over eighteen countries participating.","In conservative Muslim countries like Iran and Malaysia, photographs featuring topless or scantily clad members of primitive tribal societies are often blacked out; buyers and subscribers often complain that this practice decreases the artistic value of the photographs for which National Geographic is world-renowned.","Srirangam Temple, India (National Geographic Magazine November 1909)","Pyramid of the Niches, El Tajin, (National Geographic Magazine February 1913)","Traditional butter making in Palestine, (National Geographic Magazine March 1914)",Spanish Gypsy (National Geographic Magazine March 1917),Kathmandu Market (National Geographic Magazine October 1920),Bulgarian Muslims from Rhodopes (National Geographic Magazine October 1932),"Supplementing the articles, the magazine sometimes provides maps of the regions visited.","National Geographic Maps (originally the Cartographic Division) became a division of the National Geographic Society in 1915. The first supplement map, which appeared in the May 1918 issue of the magazine, titled The Western Theatre of War, served as a reference for overseas military personnel and soldiers' families alike.[17] On some occasions, the Society's map archives have been used by the United States government in instances where its own cartographic resources were limited.[18] President Franklin D. Roosevelt's White House map room was filled with National Geographic maps. A National Geographic map of Europe is featured in the displays of the Winston Churchill museum in London showing Churchill's markings at the Yalta Conference where the Allied leaders divided post-war Europe.","In 2001, National Geographic released an eight-CD-ROM set containing all its maps from 1888 to December 2000. Printed versions are also available from the National Geographic website.[19]","In 1995, National Geographic began publishing in Japanese, its first local language edition. The magazine is currently published in 37 local editions around the world, including one local English version in India.",The following local-language editions have been discontinued:,"In association with Trends Publications in Beijing and IDG Asia, National Geographic has been authorized for ""copyright cooperation"" in China to publish the yellow border magazine, which launched with the July 2007 issue of the magazine with an event in Beijing on July 10, 2007 and another event on December 6, 2007 in Beijing also celebrating the 29th anniversary of normalization of U.S.–China relations featuring former President Jimmy Carter. The mainland China version is one of the two local-language editions that bump the National Geographic logo off its header in favor of a local-language logo; the other one is the Persian version published under the name Gita Nama.","In contrast to the United States, where membership in the National Geographic Society was until recently the only way to receive the magazine, the worldwide editions are sold on newsstands in addition to regular subscriptions. In several countries, such as Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Turkey and Ukraine National Geographic paved the way for a subscription model in addition to traditional newsstand sales.[citation needed]","On May 1, 2008, National Geographic won three National Magazine Awards—an award solely for its written content—in the reporting category for an article by Peter Hessler on the Chinese economy; an award in the photojournalism category for work by John Stanmeyer on malaria in the Third World; and a prestigious award for general excellence.[20]",Between 1980 and 2011 the magazine has won a total of 24 National Magazine Awards.[21],"In May 2006, 2007, and 2011 National Geographic magazine won the American Society of Magazine Editors' General Excellence Award in the over two million circulation category. In 2010, National Geographic Magazine received the top ASME awards for photojournalism and essay. In 2011, National Geographic Magazine received the top-award from ASME—the Magazine of the Year Award.","In April 2014, National Geographic received the National Magazine Award (""Ellie"") for best tablet edition for its multimedia presentation of Robert Draper's story ""The Last Chase,"" about the final days of a tornado researcher who was killed in the line of duty.[22]","In February 2017, National Geographic received the National Magazine Award (""Ellie"") for best website.[23]","On the magazine's February 1982 cover, the pyramids of Giza were altered, resulting in the first major scandal of the digital photography age and contributing to photography's ""waning credibility"".[24]","In 1999, the magazine was embroiled in the Archaeoraptor scandal, in which it purported to have a fossil linking birds to dinosaurs. The fossil was a forgery.","In 2010, the magazine's Your Shot competition was awarded to William Lascelles for photography featuring a dog with fighter jets over its shoulder. The picture turned out to be a fraud.[25]"
Snoop_Dogg,"Cordozar Calvin Broadus, Jr. (born October 20, 1971),[1][2] known professionally as Snoop Dogg (sometimes shortened to Snoop and formerly called Snoop Doggy Dogg and Snoop Lion), is an American rapper and actor from Long Beach, California. His music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by Dr. Dre of N.W.A, and as a result was prominently featured throughout Dr. Dre's solo debut album, The Chronic (1992). He has since sold over twenty-three million albums in the United States and thirty-five million albums worldwide.[3][4][5]","Snoop's debut album, Doggystyle, was released in 1993 under Death Row Records, debuting at number one on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Selling almost a million copies in the first week of its release, Doggystyle became certified 4× platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit singles, including ""What's My Name?"" and ""Gin & Juice"". In 1994 Snoop released a soundtrack on Death Row Records for the short film Murder Was The Case, starring himself. His second album Tha Doggfather (1996), also debuted at number one on both charts with ""Snoop's Upside Ya Head"", as the lead single. The album was certified double platinum in 1997.","After leaving Death Row Records, Snoop signed with No Limit Records, where he recorded his next three albums. Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). Snoop then signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records in 2002, where he released Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss. He then signed with Geffen Records in 2004 for his next three albums R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin'. Malice 'n Wonderland (2009), and Doggumentary (2011), were released on Priority. Snoop Dogg has starred in motion pictures and hosted several television shows, including Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood, and Dogg After Dark. He also coaches a youth football league and high school football team. In September 2009, Snoop was hired by EMI as the chairman of a reactivated Priority Records.[6]","In 2012, after a trip to Jamaica, Snoop announced a conversion to the Rastafari movement and a new alias, Snoop Lion. Under the new moniker, he released a reggae album, Reincarnated, and a documentary film of the same name, of his Jamaican experience, in early 2013. His fourteenth solo studio album, Coolaid, was released in July 2016.",Snoop Dogg holds the dubious distinction of having seventeen Grammy nominations without a win.,"In March 2016, the night before WrestleMania 32 in Arlington, Texas, Snoop was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame having made several appearances for the company, including as Master of Ceremonies during a match at Wrestlemania XXIV.[7]",,,"Snoop Dogg was born Cordozar Calvin Broadus, Jr. in Long Beach, California,[2][8] the second of three sons.[citation needed] He was named after his stepfather, Cordozar Calvin Broadus, Sr. (1948 – 1985). His mother is Beverly Broadus (née Tate; born 1951).[9][10][11] His father, Vernell Varnado (born 1949),[10] was a Vietnam veteran, singer, and mail carrier who was said to be frequently absent from his life.[12] As a boy, his parents nicknamed him ""Snoopy"" because of his appearance, but they usually addressed him as Calvin at home.[8][13] His mother and stepfather divorced in 1975.","When he was very young, Broadus began singing and playing piano at the Golgotha Trinity Baptist Church. In sixth grade, he began rapping.[14][15]","As a teenager, Snoop Dogg frequently ran into trouble with the law. He was a member of the Rollin' 20 Crips gang in the Eastside of Long Beach,[16][17] although he stated in 1993 that he never joined a gang.[14] Shortly after graduating from high school, he was arrested for possession of cocaine, and for the following three years, was frequently in and out of prison (including Wayside Jail).[8] Snoop, along with his cousins Nate Dogg and Lil' ½ Dead, and friend Warren G, recorded homemade tapes as a group called 213, named after the Long Beach area code at the time. One of his early solo freestyles over En Vogue's ""Hold On"" had made it to a mixtape which was heard by influential producer Dr. Dre, who called to invite him to an audition. Former N.W.A associate The D.O.C. taught him how to structure his lyrics and separate the thematics into verses, hooks, and chorus.[18]","When he began recording, Broadus took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg. Dr. Dre began working with Snoop Dogg, first on the theme song of the 1992 film Deep Cover, and then on Dr. Dre's debut solo album The Chronic with the other members of his former starting group, Tha Dogg Pound. The huge success of Snoop Dogg's debut Doggystyle was partially because of this intense exposure.[8]","To fuel the ascendance of West Coast G-funk hip hop, the singles ""Who Am I (What's My Name)?"" and ""Gin and Juice"" reached of the top ten most-played songs in the United States, and the album stayed on the Billboard charts for several months.[8] Gangsta rap became the center of arguments for censorship and labeling, with Snoop Dogg often used as an example of violent and misogynistic musicians.[19] Unlike much of the harder-edged gangsta rap artists, Snoop Dogg seemed to show his softer side, said music journalist Chuck Philips.[20] In fact, the artist's favorite track on his 1993 album was a gospel-inspired tribute to his mother called Gangsta Life.[20] ""It's about how my mama raised me and my brothers on her own and how we got caught up on the streets...In the song I give my mama her respect and yet I try to show just what the wages are for kids not paying attention. I ain't no gospel rap musician, man, but I got faith in what I believe in,"" the artist told Philips.[20] Rolling Stone music critic Touré asserted that Snoop had a relatively soft vocal delivery compared to other rappers: ""Snoop's vocal style is part of what distinguishes him: where many rappers scream, figuratively and literally, he speaks softly.""[14] Doggystyle, much like The Chronic, featured a host of rappers signed to or affiliated with the Death Row label including Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, and others.","A short film about Snoop Dogg's murder trial called Murder Was The Case, was released in 1994, along with an accompanying soundtrack. On July 6, 1995, Doggy Style Records, Inc., a record label founded by Snoop Dogg, was registered with the California Secretary of State as business entity number C1923139.[21]","After Snoop Dogg was acquitted of murder charges on February 20, 1996, he and the mother of his son and their kennel of twenty pit bulls moved into a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) home in the hills of Claremont, California and by August 1996 Doggy Style Records, a subsidiary of Death Row Records, signed The Gap Band's Charlie Wilson as one of the record label's first artists.[22] He collaborated with fellow rap artist Tupac Shakur in the 1996 single 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted. This would turn out to be one of Shakur's last songs while alive; he was shot on September 7, 1996 in Las Vegas, dying 6 days later.","However, by the time Snoop Dogg's second album, Tha Doggfather, was released in November 1996, the price of living (or sometimes just imitating) the gangsta life had become very evident. Among the many notable hip hop industry deaths and convictions were the death of Snoop Dogg's friend and labelmate Tupac Shakur and the racketeering indictment of Death Row co-founder Suge Knight.[8] Dr. Dre had left Death Row earlier in 1996 because of a contract dispute, so Snoop Dogg co-produced Tha Doggfather with Daz Dillinger and DJ Pooh.","This album featured a distinct change of style as compared to Doggystyle, and the leadoff single, ""Snoop's Upside Ya Head"", featured a collaboration with Gap Band frontman Charlie Wilson. While the album sold reasonably well, it was not as successful as its predecessor. However, Tha Doggfather had a somewhat softer approach to the G-funk style. The immediate aftermath of Dr. Dre's withdrawal from Death Row Records, realizing that he was subject to an iron-clad time-based contract (i.e., that Death Row practically owned anything he produced for a number of years), Snoop Dogg refused to produce any more tracks for Suge Knight, other than the insulting ""Fuck Death Row"", until his contract expired.[16] In an interview with Neil Strauss in 1998, Snoop Dogg stated that though he had been given lavish gifts by his former label they had withheld royalty payments to the artist.[23]","Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that after Tha Doggfather, Snoop Dogg began ""moving away from his gangsta roots toward a calmer lyrical aesthetic"":[8] for instance, Snoop participated in the 1997 Lollapalooza concert tour, which featured mainly alternative rock music. Troy J. Augusto of Variety noticed that Snoop's set at Lollapalooza attracted ""much dancing, and, strangely, even a small mosh pit"" in the audience.[24]","Snoop signed with Master P's No Limit Records (distributed by Priority/EMI Records) in 1998 and debuted on the label with Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told that year. His other albums from No Limit were No Limit Top Dogg in 1999 (selling over 1,503,865 copies) and Tha Last Meal in 2000 (selling over 2,000,000).[8] In 2001, his autobiography, Tha Doggfather, was published.","In 2002, he released the album Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$, on Priority/Capitol/EMI, selling over 1,300,000 copies. The album featured the hit singles ""From tha Chuuuch to da Palace"" and ""Beautiful"", featuring guest vocals by Pharrell. By this stage in his career, Snoop Dogg had left behind his ""gangster"" image and embraced a ""pimp"" image.","In 2004, Snoop signed to Geffen Records/Star Trak Entertainment both of which were distributed through Interscope Records; Star Trak is headed by producer duo The Neptunes, which produced several tracks for Snoop's 2004 release R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece. ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" (featuring Pharrell), the first single released from the album, was a hit and became Snoop Dogg's first single to reach number one. His third release was ""Signs"", featuring Justin Timberlake and Charlie Wilson, which entered the UK chart at No. 2. This was his highest entry ever in the UK chart. The album sold 1,724,000 copies in the U.S. alone, and most of its singles were heavily played on radio and television. Snoop Dogg joined Warren G and Nate Dogg to form the group 213 and released album The Hard Way in 2004. Debuting at No.4 on the Billboard 200 and No.1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, it included single ""Groupie Luv"". Snoop Dogg appeared in the music video for Korn's ""Twisted Transistor"", along with fellow rappers Lil Jon, Xzibit, and David Banner,","Snoop Dogg's appeared on two tracks from Ice Cube's 2006 album Laugh Now, Cry Later, including the single ""Go to Church"", and on several tracks on Tha Dogg Pound's Cali Iz Active the same year. Also, his latest song, ""Real Talk"", was leaked over the Internet in the summer of 2006 and a video was later released on the Internet. ""Real Talk"" was a dedication to former Crips leader Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams and a diss to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor of California. Two other singles on which Snoop made a guest performance were ""Keep Bouncing"" by Too $hort (also with will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas) and ""Gangsta Walk"" by Coolio.","Snoop's 2006 album, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, debuted on the Billboard 200 at No.5 and has sold over 850,000 copies. The album and the second single ""That's That Shit"" featuring R. Kelly were well received by critics. In the album, he collaborated in a video with E-40 and other West Coast rappers for his single ""Candy (Drippin' Like Water)"".","In July 2007, Snoop Dogg made history by becoming the first artist to release a track as a ringtone prior to its release as a single, which was ""It's the D.O.G."". On July 7, 2007, Snoop Dogg performed at the Live Earth concert, Hamburg.[25] Snoop Dogg has ventured into singing for Bollywood with his first ever rap for an Indian movie Singh Is Kinng; the title of the song is also ""Singh is Kinng"". He also appears in the movie as himself.[26] The album featuring the song was released on June 8, 2008 on Junglee Music Records.[27] He released his ninth studio album, Ego Trippin' (selling 400,000 copies in the US), along with the first single, ""Sexual Eruption"".

The album debuted at No.23 on the Billboard 200, selling 61,000 copies its first week, making it his lowest charting album. His third single, ""I Wanna Rock"", peaked at No.41 on the Billboard Hot 100. The fourth single from Malice n Wonderland, titled ""Pronto"", featuring Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, was released on iTunes on December 1, 2009. Snoop re-released the album under the name More Malice.","Snoop collaborated with Katy Perry on ""California Gurls"", the first single from her album Teenage Dream, which was released on May 11, 2010. Snoop can also be heard on the track ""Flashing"" by Dr. Dre and on Curren$y's song ""Seat Change"". He was also featured on a new single from Australian singer Jessica Mauboy, titled ""Get 'em Girls"" (released September 2010). Snoop's latest effort was backing American recording artist, Emii, on her second single entitled ""Mr. Romeo"" (released October 26, 2010 as a follow-up to ""Magic"").

Perry ended up using the song's first take adding, ""She had a hard time accepting that as the final track. She's a perfectionist. She knows her voice really well, and she knows what's going on. She can hear things that nobody else would catch.""[184] An editor from Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman, stated that the oversinging on Aguilera's albums was inspired by Carey, writing that ""the Mariah venerators don't get away with it so easily. Aguilera, for one thing, has a slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song"".[179]","Aguilera has credited blues singer Etta James as her main influence and inspiration, elaborating, ""Etta is my all-time favorite singer.

The Sound of Music looked like a form of release.""[13] Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as two biggest inspirations for her image, ""for being re-inventive and being brave as strong females, to explore whatever, even if they do get bad press.

Alejandro_Sanz,"Alejandro Sánchez Pizarro (Spanish pronunciation: [aleˈxandɾo ˈsanθ];[1] better known as Alejandro Sanz; December 18, 1968) is a Spanish singer-songwriter and musician. For his work, Sanz has won a total of seventeen Latin Grammy Awards and three Grammy Awards. He has won the Latin Grammy for Album of the Year three times, more than any other artist. The singer is notable for his flamenco-influenced ballads, but he has also experimented with rock, funk, electronic, jazz and many genres from latin music.","Born in Madrid to parents from Andalusia, Sanz began playing guitar at age seven, taking influence from his family's flamenco roots. Sanz released his debut album at age nineteen, although he did not gain commercial success in Spain until his second release, Viviendo Deprisa. His next two records, Si Tú Me Miras (1993) and 3 (1995) also fared well commercially, but it was his 1997 breakthrough album Más that garnered international success. El Alma al Aire followed in 2000, selling more than a million copies in its first week. In 2002, he became the first Spanish artist to record an MTV Unplugged album.","His collaboration with Shakira on the 2005 single ""La Tortura"" reached number one on several charts worldwide. His albums No Es lo Mismo (2003) and El Tren de los Momentos (2006) showed Sanz experimenting with more diverse styles of music, while his 2009 release, Paraíso Express served as a return to form for the musician. He signed to Universal Music Group in 2011 and released his tenth studio album, La Música No Se Toca, on September 25, 2012, followed by Sirope on May 4, 2015.",,,"Sanz was born in Madrid, Spain, on December 18, 1968, the youngest son of María Pizarro and Jesús Sánchez.[2] He grew up in the neighborhood of Moratalaz in eastern Madrid.[3] Sanz recalled that ""Back then, kids grew up on the street...I was a bit like the group troubadour; the one who played the guitar and sang. That kept me out of a lot of trouble.""[3] Sanz's father, a door-to-door book salesman, played guitar professionally, which inspired seven-year-old Sanz to learn to play the instrument.[2][4] He pursued the instrument with an intensity that eventually frustrated his mother, who broke his guitar one morning after his playing kept the family from sleeping.[4]","He was exposed to traditional flamenco music as a child while vacationing each summer in his parents' native Andalusia in southern Spain.[4] Originally, Sanz intended to become a flamenco performer, but he found the music teachers to be overly strict. Commenting on his early experiences, Sanz explained, ""Flamenco can be very hard on beginners. If you lose the rhythm, they toss you out with, 'You're no good, boy!' They're very strict and very cruel. But it's also a marvelous education, because you either learn to play or else.""[4] He felt that he could not compete with his peers, and decided to focus on creating pop music with flamenco influences, viewing flamenco to be a ""lifestyle"" better suited to others.[5]","As a teenager, Sanz performed in various venues in his hometown. He became acquainted with Miguel Ángel Arenas, a music industry executive who had signed several popular Spanish groups such as Mecano.[2] Arenas helped Sanz find work, eventually leading to a record deal with the Spanish label Hispavox.[2] In 1989 Sanz released his debut album, Los Chulos Son Pa' Cuidarlos under the name of Alejandro Magno (Spanish for ""Alexander the Great"").[5] The record, which fused techno and flamenco, was met with critical and commercial indifference, and today Sanz views the record to be ""insignificant"".[4] However, the album is now considered to be a collector's item.[2] In an attempt to promote Los Chulos Son Pa' Cuidarlos, he performed at strip clubs, playing short sets between acts.[4] This proved to be unsuccessful and Sanz took a break from music, choosing to study business administration.[4] He also took a job at a recording studio in which he wrote material for other artists. He persuaded Arenas to send demos of his songs to record companies, which led to being signed by Warner Music Latina.[4] At this time, he began performing under his current name.[2]","Sanz's rise to fame began in 1991, when he released his first album from Warner, Viviendo Deprisa. The record and the songs ""Pisando Fuerte"" and ""Se le Apagó la Luz"" helped him gain a dedicated fan base in Spain.[6] In 1993, he released Si Tú Me Miras shortly followed by a live album, titled Básico. That same year, he recorded a song entitled ""Mi Primera Canción"" with flamenco pioneer Paco de Lucía, whom Sanz idolized as a child.[7] He released his third studio album since changing his stage name, 3, in 1995. In addition to Spanish, 3 was also released in Italian and Portuguese.[8] ""La Fuerza del Corazón"", the first single released from 3, was his first song to chart internationally.[2] All three albums proved to be successful, reaching multi-platinum status in Spain.[2]","Sanz spent two years in Milan, Italy to work on a follow-up for 3.[11] For the album, he wished to create a ""true fusion"" of many different sounds, and began studying the saxophone and piano in addition to guitar.[11] In 1997, Sanz released his fifth studio album, Más, a record containing ballads strongly influenced by flamenco, pop, and tropical rhythms.[12] Driven by the singles ""Corazón Partío"", ""Y, ¿Si Fuera Ella?"", ""Amiga Mía"", ""Aquello Que Me Diste"", and ""Siempre Es de Noche"", Más sold more than two million copies in Spain and was certified 22× Platinum in the country, making it the best-selling album in Spanish history.[2][5][13][14] The album remained on the Billboard Latin Albums chart for 74 weeks, and one year after the record's release, Sanz was granted an Ondas Award for Best Song for ""Corazón Partío"".[15][16] According to David Cazares of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, the album ""made Sanz an international star on the strength of the pop-salsa hit 'Corazón Partío', a song on the lips of fans from Spain to Cuba and the United States.""[6] Following the success of the album, Sanz began touring in United States for the first time.[5]","This record is important because it represents me choosing what I want to do...You're always learning things about music if you want to, and you can apply it to what you want to do. It has a rhythmic complexity and a proximity to flamenco, however it's less obvious.","His fifth album, El Alma al Aire, released September 26, 2000, featured Sanz exploring a wider array of musical genres, including jazz, R&B, soul and tango.[6] In Spain, the album sold more than one million copies in the first week, breaking the record of one million copies sold in four months, also set by Sanz with his previous album, Más.[18][19] At the 2001 Latin Grammy Awards, Sanz walked away with four awards: Best Pop Male Vocal Album and Album of the Year for El Alma al Aire, and Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the title track from the album.[20] Later that year, El Alma al Aire was released in a special edition including Sanz's duets with Irish band The Corrs. In October 2001, Sanz collaborated with Michael Jackson and various other artists on the Spanish version of the charity single ""What More Can I Give"", which benefited the victims of the September 11 attacks.[18][21]","In 2002, Sanz recorded MTV Unplugged at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, Florida.[5] He was the first Spanish artist to record and release an MTV Unplugged album.[22] For Sanz, the recording of the album ""changed the way I do my music. It was a rediscovery of how to perform, and also how to record, music with live musicians. That was the spirit of the music in its pure form, though [it is ironic] that the more people who are playing, the more simple it is.""[5] With the MTV Unplugged, he garnered three Latin Grammy Awards (Album of the Year, Recording of the Year and Song of the Year for ""Y Sólo Se Me Ocurre Amarte"").[23]","On September 2, 2003, Sanz released his sixth studio album, No Es lo Mismo. On this record, Sanz took a more political approach than he had on previous releases. The song ""Sandy a Orilla do Mundo"" discusses oil spills on the Spanish coast, while ""Labana"" tells the story of people fleeing from Cuba on makeshift rafts.[24] The album won four awards at the 2004 Latin Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year.[25] Sanz was unable to attend the event and his awards were accepted by presenters and colleagues.[25] Also in 2004, he became the first Spanish musician to give a lecture at Harvard University, speaking about Hispanic culture at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.[26]","In 2005, Sanz collaborated with Shakira on her song ""La Tortura"". Co-written by Sanz, the song became an international hit, breaking the record for the most weeks at the number one spot on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[27] The song exposed Sanz to a more diverse audience, and helped build anticipation for his next release.[2] The first single from the album El Tren de los Momentos, ""A la Primera Persona"", became his first song to enter the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 100 on the chart.[2][28] The record was also noted for its guest appearances, which featured Shakira, Juanes, Alex González of Maná, and Residente of Calle 13.[2]","In the spring of 2007, Sanz suffered a mental breakdown and took two months off in the middle of a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel.[29] He commented on the situation, saying ""You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. So I had to pay. A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely.""[29] Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which ""helped [him] a lot"" and gave him ""more power"" to perform.[29]","In a press conference in late 2007, he criticized Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, calling him ""undemocratic"" in the wake of a petition made by Venezuelan citizens to prevent Chávez from running for re-election.[6][30] Sanz further stated ""If they gave me 3 million signatures to stop singing, I would stop singing immediately.""[30] Supporters of Chávez subsequently gathered 230,000 signatures in response to Sanz' comments.[30]","To promote his new record, Paraíso Express, Sanz started a campaign in which fans could create a video about their definition of paradise and upload it to his YouTube channel.[31] Artists such as Shakira, Laura Pausini and Paulina Rubio also participated.[31] On November 10, 2009, Sanz released Paraíso Express. This record was described as a return to form for Sanz, focusing more on melody as opposed to the experimentation he pursued on his previous two albums.[32] He commented that ""On this album, I first composed the melody and then the lyrics. It is more of a rock album than my past releases, with more elegant and positive lyrics and a happier and more rhythmic spirit.""[33] The bilingual single ""Looking for Paradise"" featuring Alicia Keys reached number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart.[34] At the 2010 Latin Grammy Awards, the album was nominated Album of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Album, while the single ""Desde Cuándo"" received both Record and Song of the Year nominations.[35]","On February 15, 2011, Sanz announced that he would be signing with Universal Music Group after twenty years with Warner.[36] In the same year, Sanz received the Latin Heritage Award by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in recognition of his contributions to Latin music.[37] On September 2, 2012, the singer unveiled the official artwork of his upcoming ninth studio album, La Música No Se Toca on his official site.[38] Sanz released La Música No Se Toca, featuring the single ""No Me Compares"" and based on the opening theme song in the telenovela Amores Verdaderos, on September 25, 2012.[39] On August 21, 2012,[40] Sanz released his new single ""Irrepetível (Me Sumerjo)"", a duet with Brazilian singer-songwriter Ana Carolina. The song is a Portuguese-Spanish song and it's only available in Brazil's iTunes. On September 17, he released the album's second single, ""Se Vende"". In 2013, Sanz was recognized as the Pop Male Artist of the Year and was the recipient of the Excellence Award at the 26th Lo Nuestro Awards for his achievements in the music industry.[41]","On November 6, 2013 Sanz received an honorary doctor of music degree from Berklee College of Music.[42] “It is a great honor for me to receive this doctorate degree from one of the most prestigious music schools in the world,” Sanz said of the Berklee recognition. “I will continue to work every day of my life to deserve this honor.”[43] Sanz released his eleventh studio album, Sirope, featuring the single ""A Que No Me Dejas"", a collaboration with Alejandro Fernandez and used as the opening theme song in the telenovela A Que No Me Dejas, on May 4, 2015.[44] The album took a year and one month to record, and features an ""eclectic sound"" in Sanz's words, containing elements of flamenco, R&B, and folk music.[44] He worked with producer Sebastian Krys, who helped him ""enrich what was there but [not lose] the essence"" of the songs.[44]","Early in his career, Sanz' music generally consisted of romantic ballads. However, in the late 1990s, his collaborations with other artists greatly expanded his musical style.[2] On No Es lo Mismo, he experimented with rock, salsa, and hip hop.[5] While recording the album, Sanz noted that he often entered the studio with a rough idea for a song and the guest artists would ""contaminate it with their rhythms...in a good way.""[24] El Tren de los Momentos continued this pattern of musical experimentation, featuring diverse genres such as funk, jazz, and country.[45] Despite this, Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic described his musical evolution by saying ""Even as Sanz broadened his style over the years, he never ventured far from his strength: romantic songs, generally ballads, tinged with flamenco and sung wholeheartedly with his distinct voice.""[2]","Sanz is known for his distinctive raspy vocals, which he attributes to his flamenco roots, crediting singer Camarón de la Isla as a major influence.[46][47] His song ""Sí, He Cantado Mal"" (Yes, I Have Sung Badly) from No Es lo Mismo references this, with Sanz saying ""I'm laughing a little at myself so that I can laugh at other things. Sometimes, I'm harder on myself than any music critic can be. I'm laughing at that.""[46] Throughout his youth, Sanz was heavily influenced by English-language heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden and Dio, referring to himself as a ""heavy metal radical"".[46] He also feels that living in the city of Cadiz had a major impact on his musical style, where ""Any 7-year-old kid you find knows how to play guitar, play the cajón, knows how to sing. When the family comes together we start to sing. In a way it's not just music, it's culture.""[47]","Sanz married Mexican fashion model and actress Jaydy Michel in Bali on December 30, 1999, but this marriage was never legally recognized in either of their home countries. Sanz felt that having a legally recognized marriage was unnecessary: ""My wife is my wife and I am her husband. For me, that has enough validity...I am married with the heart.""[48] Their daughter, Manuela Sánchez Michel, was born on July 28, 2001. The couple separated in 2005.[29] Sanz later had a son named Alexander with Valeria Rivera, a Puerto Rican fashion designer.[49]","Sanz married his former assistant, Raquel Perera, on May 23, 2012 in a private ceremony held in Sabadell, Barcelona.[50] They have two children: a son, Dylan, born in 2011 in New York,[51] and a daughter, Alma, born in 2014 in Madrid.","Flamengo guitarist Paco de Lucía is the godfather of Sanz's son, and Sanz and his wife are godparents to David Bisbal's daughter, Ella.[52]","In addition to music, Sanz enjoys painting, which he often does while trying to create ideas for new songs.[53] He explains that painting ""teaches you that taking risks rarely leads to failure. In fact, from the moment you assume a risk, you have succeeded.""[4]"

At Euro 2012, Iniesta led Spain to their second consecutive continental crown, again being chosen as the Man of the Match of the final against Italy, and was named the Player of the Tournament.","Iniesta is widely considered to be one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest midfielders of all time.[4][5][6][7] Since 2009, he has been chosen in the UEFA Team of the Year six times and has been voted into the FIFA World XI on eight occasions. Iniesta won the UEFA Best Player in Europe award in 2012 and was named the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker in 2012 and 2013. He was runner-up to Lionel Messi for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or and achieved third place in 2012.",,,"Iniesta comes from Fuentealbilla, a small village in the province of Albacete, Castile–La Mancha. At the age of 12, while playing for Albacete Balompié in a junior seven-a-side tournament in Albacete, he attracted the attention of scouts from clubs around Spain.[8] His parents knew Barcelona's youth team coach, Enrique Orizaola, and he persuaded them to consider sending Iniesta to the Barcelona youth academy. Iniesta traveled there with his parents and visited La Masia, the farmhouse where the club houses its young players; the trip convinced them to enroll Iniesta in the Barcelona youth ranks.[9]","""Receive, pass, offer, receive, pass, offer.""","Iniesta says he ""cried rivers"" the day he left for La Masia and struggled being separated from his parents;[11] he was very shy and kept to himself while there.[12] He captained the Barcelona Under-15 team to victory in the Nike Premier Cup of 1999, scoring the winning goal in the last minute of the final, and was named player of the tournament. Just after Iniesta arrived at the club, then-captain Pep Guardiola famously told fellow midfielder Xavi: ""You're going to retire me. This lad [Iniesta] is going to retire us all.""[4]","In the 2004–05 season, Iniesta featured in 37 out of 38 league games—more than any other player—although 25 of these were substitute appearances. He scored twice as Barcelona won La Liga.[13] An injury to Xavi at the start of the 2005–06 season allowed Iniesta more regular starts in the centre of midfield, and he continued to improve and develop.[14] He played in 11 UEFA Champions League games, including a half-time appearance in the 2006 final, to replace Edmílson.[15] His contribution to the team was praised by manager Frank Rijkaard as Barcelona won a league and Champions League double.[16]","The 2006–07 season saw Iniesta's profile continue to rise and he earned plaudits for his willingness to play in any position for his team. In the pre-season, he lifted the Joan Gamper Trophy as the captain of the team after a 4–0 victory over German side Bayern Munich. Iniesta played for the first time as a left wing-forward for Barça in two Champions League matches against Levski Sofia, finding the net twice. In the first knockout stage of the same competition, he played in central midfield against Liverpool. Despite being moved around the pitch by manager Rijkaard, the 2006–07 season remains Iniesta's highest scoring thus far.","With the departure of Ludovic Giuly ahead of the 2007–08 campaign, Iniesta was able to switch his number 24 shirt for his preferred number 8.[17] Despite rumours of a possible transfer before the season,[18] he extended his contract to 2014 on 25 January 2008,[19] with his buy-out clause being raised to €150 million.[20] Don Balón, a member of European Sports Magazines, named Iniesta one of the most consistent performers in the previous two seasons of La Liga; he placed fifth in 2006–07 and fourth in 2007–08.[21][22] He also placed ninth in the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year voting, gaining 37 total points.[23]","At the start of the 2008–09 season, in September 2008, Iniesta was elected the fourth-choice captain behind, in order of preference, Carles Puyol, Xavi and Víctor Valdés; all four were products of the Barcelona youth system.[24] His performances throughout the season were highly lauded, and he received standing ovations both in Barcelona at the Camp Nou, as well as from rival supporters in away matches.[25] A leg injury sustained in mid-November 2008 left Iniesta sidelined until 3 January; initially expected to return to action in six weeks, he did not want to come back until he was 100 percent. Upon his return to action, as a 65th-minute substitute against Mallorca, he scored a crucial goal after just ten minutes on the pitch and completed a Barcelona comeback in front of the Camp Nou.[26]","Iniesta sustained another injury during a home match against Málaga, but returned to action for the first leg Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich, which Barcelona won 4–0.[27] He scored a vital equaliser in the final minute of stoppage time during the second leg of the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, with a curling strike with the outside of his right foot 25 yards from goal, securing the tie on away goals as the match finished 1–1.[28] In the season review, Un Any Al Paradis, Iniesta wrote, ""I connected with that shot with the outside, not the inside or the tip of my boot, but right from my heart, with all my might.""[29]","""I knew I would play injured and do more damage. For 17 days, all I thought about was the final in Rome and winning, even knowing that I would do more damage. I'd repeat it, for sure. I love this club and my profession and I wanted to win. If we had lost the final that would have been a total disaster.""","Iniesta's goal against Chelsea sent Barcelona through to the final in Rome against defending champions Manchester United. Prior to the final, United manager Alex Ferguson identified Iniesta as Barça's biggest threat: ""He's fantastic. He makes the team work. The way he finds passes, his movement and ability to create space is incredible. He's so important for Barcelona.""[11] Despite a thigh injury, Iniesta played and was influential in the game, providing the assist for the first goal scored by Samuel Eto'o as his team went on to win 2–0.[31] In his analysis, David Pleat wrote, ""In the end the midfield artistry of Iniesta and Xavi, helped by [Lionel] Messi, was the critical factor.""[32] After the game, United striker Wayne Rooney described Iniesta as the best player in the world.[33]","Iniesta received plaudits for his performances that season; Don Balón rated him as the league's most consistent performer.[34] Later that year, he placed fifth for the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year award, with 134 votes,[35] and fourth for the prestigious Ballon d'Or, receiving 149 points.[36] Barcelona extended his contract by one year, until 2015, and raised his buy-out clause to €200 million.[37]","Barcelona won a second successive league title in the 2009–10 season, securing a record 99 points. Individually, however, Iniesta endured a campaign largely disrupted by recurring injuries. He missed pre-season fitness training due to the thigh tear suffered in the 2009 Champions League final.[38] Despite featuring in almost as many matches as the previous season, he did so mostly as a substitute, starting only 20 games throughout.[39] His season came to a premature end in April after he aggravated a previous calf injury during training.[40]","A contributing factor of Iniesta's fractured season were the episodes of psychological instability he suffered privately following the death of his close friend Daniel Jarque, a fellow footballer, in August 2009. Even when physically fit, he was often unable to complete training sessions or exert himself. After seeking psychological help, he experienced catharsis when he scored Spain's match-winning goal in the 2010 FIFA World Cup final, which he dedicated to Jarque by revealing the message ""Dani Jarque, always with us"" written on his undershirt.[41] ""I did it because I felt it deeply,"" Iniesta said at the time. ""It showed that what is more important than rivalry, your team or your colours is to be human and a good person. I am delighted because it was the most important moment in my career.""[42] Regarding the recurrent injuries that plagued his season, he said, ""It was hard, but I will start with more desire than ever.""[42]","Iniesta scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season during the opening league fixture against Racing de Santander, lobbing the ball into the net from a distance of 30 yards.[43] Throughout the campaign, he received standing ovations from opposition fans, including at El Sardinero and the Vicente Calderón Stadium, in appreciation of his World Cup-winning goal.[44] Another standing ovation came on the home pitch of Espanyol in the Derbi barceloní, with the crowd acknowledging his friendship with Daniel Jarque, Espanyol's captain at the time of his death.[45] Iniesta was one of the three finalists for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or alongside Xavi and Messi, placing as runner-up behind the Argentine.[46]","Iniesta started the 2011–12 season by scoring the opening goal in the second leg of the Supercopa de España against rivals Real Madrid. Barcelona went on to win the match 3–2 and the cup 5–4 on aggregate. One of his best goals followed in October against Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League group stage after an interchange of passes with Messi. Iniesta played a record 51 matches unbeaten in La Liga, concluding with Barcelona's 2–0 defeat of Mallorca on 24 March.[47] In the Champions League, he ended a goal drought by scoring a vital goal against Milan in the quarter-finals. From there, he went on to score in the semi-final against Chelsea to make the scoreline 2–0, but the match ended 2–2, eliminating his team 3–2 on aggregate. Towards the end of the year, on 25 November, Iniesta was named man of the match after scoring one goal and providing three assists in a 4–0 win over Levante.[48] His performances earned him third place in the voting of the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[49]","Iniesta signed a new contract with Barcelona in December 2013, keeping him at the club until 2018.[50] As vice-captain, he regularly captained Barça throughout the club's second treble-winning campaign of the 2014–15 season. Iniesta scored three times during the team's Copa del Rey campaign,[51] and was man of the match in the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, having assisted Ivan Rakitić's opening goal in the 3–1 defeat of Italian champions Juventus at Berlin's Olympiastadion.[52] Their European victory made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup twice;[53] Iniesta was among the seven players to have been a part of both treble-winning teams.[53]","During the first Clásico of the 2015–16 season, on 21 November, Iniesta became only the third Barcelona player, after Diego Maradona in 1983 and Ronaldinho in 2005, to receive applause from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu.[54] His man-of-the-match performance included a goal and an assist, contributing to a resounding 4–0 victory.[55]","Iniesta burst on to the international scene in 2001, helping Spain win the UEFA European Under-16 Championship. After representing his country at the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship held in Trinidad and Tobago,[56] he was in the squad that claimed the UEFA European Under-19 Championship the following year. From then, he became a regular choice for youth coach Juan Santisteban. In 2003, he was part of the side that reached the FIFA World Youth Championship final in the United Arab Emirates, and was named in the FIFA all-star team.[57] During his spell with the Spain U21 side, Iniesta was named captain on several occasions.","Iniesta was called up to represent the senior Spain squad at the 2006 FIFA World Cup on 15 May 2006, much to the surprise of many. He won his first cap for La Furia Roja when he was brought on at half-time in a friendly against Russia on 27 May.[57] His first goal followed in a friendly against England on 7 February 2007. His long-range effort, hitting the underside of the crossbar on the way in, gave Spain the lead on 63 minutes. Iniesta played a pivotal part in Spain's qualification for UEFA Euro 2008 by scoring goals against Sweden and by assisting the strikers.","Iniesta was selected in Spain's squad for UEFA Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. Though a stomach ailment somewhat hampered his performances in the group stages, he still played an integral part in the midfield. He played in the first two of Spain's group stage matches and proved an important part of the team, providing a pass for David Villa's second goal against Russia. He was not rested, unlike most of Spain's regulars, for the final group game against Greece, which Spain won 2–1 thanks to a volley from Rubén de la Red and a late winner from Daniel Güiza. Iniesta returned for the quarter-final as Spain beat Italy on penalties; he was substituted before the penalty shootout itself. In the semi-final against Russia, he played the entire 90 minutes and produced a cross that Xavi converted to open the scoring; he was subsequently named the Man of the Match.[58] He played the duration of the final in Spain's 1–0 win over Germany. Iniesta was named in the Team of the Tournament alongside fellow Spain midfielders Xavi, Marcos Senna and six other teammates. Iniesta did not participate in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa due to a thigh muscle injury; Spain was eliminated from the tournament at the semi-final stage.[59]","Iniesta was selected for Spain in the 2010 World Cup and scored the second goal in a 2–1 group stage win against Chile. He was also named man of the match.[60] For his excellent performances in helping Spain reach the final of the tournament, Iniesta was shortlisted for the Golden Ball award.[61] During the final, he scored the winning goal in the 116th minute of a 1–0 win against Netherlands.[62] He earned a yellow card for removing his jersey during his celebration to reveal his message to his late friend Dani Jarque.[63] He won the man of the match award for his performance in the final, which gave Spain its first-ever World Cup.[64]","At UEFA Euro 2012, Iniesta was awarded the man of the match award for his performances in three different matches. He was also selected as man of the match in the final against Italy, which Spain won 4–0. In winning the award, Iniesta became the only Spanish player to win the award at least once in each of Spain's three consecutive successful tournaments.[65] Iniesta was also chosen as the UEFA Euro 2012 Player of the Tournament.[66]","At the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, Iniesta was named in the Team of the Tournament and awarded the Silver Ball for the second best player in the competition, as Spain finished runner-up to host nation Brazil.[67] Iniesta started all three matches for Spain at the 2014 World Cup, winning his 100th cap in the team's final group match against Australia.[68] At UEFA Euro 2016, he assisted the only goal of the match against Czech Republic and put in a man of the match display to give Spain a winning start in the tournament.[69]","Like fellow La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas, Iniesta originally started as a defensive midfielder,[70] but his balance, ball control and agility allied with his skill on the ball saw him make progress as an attacking midfielder. Beyond his raw talent that was spotted at a young age by Barcelona's scouts, it was his great versatility, work ethic and inventiveness that allowed him to stake a claim on a first-team place at the age of 18.[71] Vicente del Bosque described him as ""the complete footballer. He can attack and defend, he creates and scores,"" and Frank Rijkaard said, ""I played him as a false winger, central midfielder, deep midfielder and just behind the striker and he was always excellent.""[11] He was used initially as a wide-forward in the absence of Juan Román Riquelme and Ronaldinho by Louis van Gaal and Rijkaard respectively, but made his name as a world-class player in central midfield alongside or in lieu of Xavi, at both club and international level. As FIFA.com says, ""It is in this position that his direct style and quick feet can be used to full effect, with the ball seeming glued to his toes as he races into threatening positions. Iniesta is a player known for his passing, dribbling, vision and movement.""[72]","""The one who plays this game the best is Iniesta: he knows exactly when to go forward and when to drop back. He picks the right moment to do everything: when to dribble, when to speed things up and when to slow things down. And I think that’s the only thing that can’t be taught or bought. You can learn how to shoot and how to control the ball, but being aware of everything that’s happening out on the pitch – that’s something you’re either born with or you’re not.""","Much like other Barcelona youth products such as Pep Guardiola, Xavi and Iván de la Peña, Iniesta is a playmaker who relies on exceptional creative passing, intuition and inventiveness to control the midfield and dictate the ebb and flow of play.[74] Iniesta has been praised for his understanding and interplay with Xavi; former Barcelona teammate Giovanni van Bronckhorst said of the pair, ""They have a special relationship, they always have, they just seem to know where the other one is.""[75] During his maturation as a player, he has gained a reputation for playing a part in important goals for club and country, specifically playing a leading role in the 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015 UEFA Champions League finals, as well as the 2010 World Cup Final, Euro 2012 final and Euro 2008 semi-final.[71]","His willingness to play anywhere on the pitch has earned him the sobriquet El Ilusionista (The Illusionist), El Cerebro (The Brain), El Anti-Galáctico (a pun on Real Madrid players' nickname Los Galácticos), El Caballero Pálido (The Pale Knight)[76] and most recently Don Andrés from the Spanish press. Zinedine Zidane also praised Iniesta, stating on the Spanish radio station Cadena COPE, ""Iniesta really impresses me. He's got so much influence in Spain's game. He reminds me of myself."" Fernando Torres, Spain's striker, said, ""We've been playing together since we were 15 and I have never, ever seen him play badly.""[77] He is widely regarded as one of the most respected and best midfielders of all time.[4][5][6][7]","Iniesta has a sponsorship deal with American sportswear and equipment supplier, Nike, and has appeared in Nike commercials alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Zlatan Ibrahimović and Wayne Rooney.[78] Iniesta features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series, and was the sixth-highest rated player in FIFA 15.[79] In March 2015, Iniesta had the ninth highest social media rank in the world among sportspeople, with 24 million Facebook fans.[80][81]","Iniesta is married to Anna Ortiz; the couple began dating in 2008 and wed on 8 July 2012.[82][83] They have a daughter, Valeria (born April 2011), and a son, Paolo Andrea (born May 2015).[84] Their third child, Andrés Jr., was stillborn in March 2014.[85] Iniesta is a Catholic.[86]","In 2011, Iniesta invested €420,000 in his boyhood club, Albacete, thus becoming its major shareholder.[87] Two years later, with the club facing administrative relegation to the fourth tier of Spanish football, he loaned them a further €240,000 to cover unpaid wages.[88]"
Sachin_Tendulkar,"Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (i/ˌsətʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/; born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian cricketer and captain, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International, the holder of the record for the number of runs in both ODI and Test cricket, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.[5]","In 2002, just halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[6] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[7] He had previously been named ""Player of the Tournament"" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[8][9][10]","Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards.[11] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[12][13] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[14][15] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[16] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[17] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[18] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[19][20]","In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[21] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[22] and subsequently announced his retirement from all forms of cricket,[23][24] retiring on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th and final Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[25] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]h",,,"Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 in a Maharashtrian family.[26] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[27] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children from his first marriage.[28] Although, Sachin has not mentioned this even in his autobiography. He spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[29] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[30] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced him to cricket in 1984. He introduced the young Sachin to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[citation needed] Ajit is ten years elder and is credited by Sachin for playing a pivotal role in his life.[31]","Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers.[32] Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[32] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[33] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[34] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[32]","Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in his school Shardashram Vidyamandir (English) team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (popularly coined MGSM) Shield.[35] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League,[32] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India.[36][37][38] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[39] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[40] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's ""Best junior cricket award"" (He was 14 years that time). ""It was the greatest source of encouragement for me,"" Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[41][42] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[43][44] In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and team-mate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[45] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.[46]","On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[32] He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[32] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged just 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket. He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets,[1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[47]","Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the sixth highest run-scorer overall[48] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[49] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[50] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[51]","His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[1][52] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[53] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[54][55][56]","In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.[57]","Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[58] and that too after just one first class season.[59] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged just 16 years and 205 days. He made just 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[60] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[61] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[62] This was later called ""one of the best innings I have seen"" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[63] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[64][65] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[66][67]","The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[68] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[69] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[61] Wisden described his innings as ""a disciplined display of immense maturity"" and also wrote:[70]","He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen.","Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that ""This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB.""[71]","Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. On the day of the Hindu festival Holi, Tendulkar was told to open the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994.[72] He went on to make 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[73][74] It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.","Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[75] He was the only Indian batsman to perform in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[76]","After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[citation needed] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off just one over.[77] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[78]","This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Sachin Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, and the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a full-fledged Test series after 7 long years.[citation needed] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar famously simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[citation needed] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[79] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[80][81] These were characterised by a premeditated plan to target Australian spinners Shane Warne and Gavin Robertson, to whom he regularly charged down the pitch to drive over the infield.[citation needed] This technique worked as India beat Australia in the ensuing Test series as well.[citation needed] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for just 32 runs in 10 overs.[82] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia tormenting Shane Warne once again. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[83] The innings in the finals was incidentally played on his 25th birthday. Following the series Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[84]","Tendulkar single-handedly won the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka to pave way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in just 128 balls.[85]","The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999. Held just twice, the 1999 championship was contested by India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[86] The first Test match between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens was previously scheduled as the third Test match of the tournament but later on was shifted to the first match. In the first match, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support team India during the initial four days of the tournament. The aggregate Test attendance record which was made 63 years ago was broken during this Test.[87] The crowd's reaction to the dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd, however further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of just 200 people.[88] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[89] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[90]","In the historic Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12 runs.[91] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.[92] However, he returned to the World Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[93]","Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying ""Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!"",[96] which translates into: ""He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!"".[97]","Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.[98] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award[98] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[99] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.[100][101]","Tendulkar remained an integral part of the Indian team's strategic processes. He was often seen in discussion with the captain, at times actively involved in building strategies.[citation needed] Former captain Rahul Dravid publicly acknowledged that Tendulkar had been suggesting moves such as the promotion of Irfan Pathan up the batting order which, although only temporary, had an immediate effect on the team's fortunes.[citation needed] In 2007, Tendulkar was appointed vice-captain to captain Rahul Dravid.[102][not in citation given] During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, Dravid's desire to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar personally offered the captaincy to Tendulkar. However, Tendulkar asked Pawar not to appoint him captain, instead recommending Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[102]","In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[103] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[104] This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[105] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[106] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[107] The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[108]","Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test.[109] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[110]","In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Sir Donald Bradman's record of 29 Test hundreds.[111][112][113] Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings,[114] getting out to technical ""defects"" and uncharacteristically poor strokes.[citation needed] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86. However, India lost the series.[115] This might have been the beginning of the ""decline"" phase in his career which lasted till 2006.[original research?] In the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[116][117]","Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[118] helping India reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[119][120]","He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[121][122] As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final.[123]","The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[124] Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests.[citation needed] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.[125][better source needed]","Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. India declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he passed the landmark in Tests.[126] In meeting with the press that evening, Tendulkar stated that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[127] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[128][129] After India won the match, the captain Rahul Dravid stated that the matter was spoken internally and put to rest.[130]","A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004.[131][132] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.[133]","On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest[needs update] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.[134] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan.[135] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[136] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory.[137] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,[138] the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar was to end the three-Test series without a single half-century to his credit, and news of a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.[citation needed] In July 2006, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced that Tendulkar had overcome his injury problem following an operation and rehabilitation programme and was available for selection, and he was eventually selected for the next series.[citation needed]","Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century.[citation needed] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.[139]","During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar was criticised by Greg Chappell on his attitude.[140] As per the report, Chappell felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career. Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach has ever suggested his attitude towards cricket is incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[141]","At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka.[citation needed] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of the then Indian coach Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his column for Mumbai's Mid Day newspaper.[142]","In the subsequent Test series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series.[143] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs.[144] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.[145][146]","On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs.[147] In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India[148] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.[149]","Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings.[citation needed] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career.[150] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali,[151] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.[152]","In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings.[153] Sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia.[154] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings.[155][156] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins.[157] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4.[158] He secured the Man of the Match award.[159]","In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs.[160] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the CB series well notching up scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32, but could not convert the starts into bigger scores.[161] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament,[original research?] but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls.[162] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final,[163] and 91 runs in the second final.[164]","South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series;[166] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.[167]","Before the touring Sri Lanka for three Test in July 2008, Tendulkar needed just 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of just 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.[168]","In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[169] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[170] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most number of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61.[171][172] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[173] He made a fifty in the third Test[174] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[175]","Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[176] and 50 in the fifth,[177] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[178][179]","England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks.[178][179] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh.[180] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win.[181] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[182] Tendulkar failed in both innings in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.[183]","In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai.[citation needed] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.[184]","India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match[185] and eventually won the series 3–1.[186] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[187] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test[188] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.[189][190]","Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[191] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46[192] and 27[193] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[194] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[195]","Tendulkar played just one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[196] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain[197] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.[198]","Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[199] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[200] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs.[201][202] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[202][203] and achieved his personal best against Australia,[204] as well as the third highest score in a defeat.[205]","In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[206] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[207] India won the series 3–1.[208] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.[209]","Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series.[210] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.[211][212]","In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test.[213] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[214][215] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry.[Note 2]","From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament.[221] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.[222] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that ""Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy.""[223]","India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.[228] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[229][230] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[229] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[231][232]","Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[233] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[citation needed] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[234] The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[235]","Tendulkar scored his much awaited 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[236] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat. Incidentally, it was Tendulkar's first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said ""It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds.""[237] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[238]","After getting out bowled on 3 similar instances against the New Zealand recently and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home, in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. All eyes were on Tendulkar, who was playing his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. And he did not disappoint smashing 137 off 136 balls with 21 fours and 3 Sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.[239]","However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[240] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs.[241] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.[242][243]","Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[244] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[245] In the semi final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[246] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[247] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[248] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[249]","He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar's Indian record for most first-class hundreds.[250][251][252]","Following poor performance in the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his retirement from One Day Internationals on 23 December 2012, while noting that he will be available for Test cricket.[253][254] In response to the news, former India captain Sourav Ganguly noted that Tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against Pakistan, while Anil Kumble said it would be ""tough to see an Indian (ODI) team list without Tendulkar's name in it"", and Javagal Srinath mentioned that Tendulkar ""changed the way ODIs were played right from the time he opened in New Zealand in 1994"".[255]","After playing his lone Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he stated that he would not play T20 Internationals any more.[256] He announced his retirement from IPL after his team Mumbai Indians beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Pepsi Indian Premier League 2013.[22] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.[257]","On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November.[23][24] Later the BCCI confirmed that the two matches will be played at Kolkata and Mumbai, making the farewell happen at his home ground on Tendulkar's request.[258][259] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket.[25] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport.[260][261] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today.[262][263]","In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[264] In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event.[265][266] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket world cup 2011.[267][268] So he is heading the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).","Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008.[272] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.[273]","In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[274] Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.[275]",Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[276],"In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51 matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.[277] In 2013, Sachin retired from Indian Premier League and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the Mumbai Indian Team's 'Icon'.[278]","Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[279][280] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the ""most wholesome batsman of his time"".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[281] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that ""it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does"".[282]","Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that ""Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar.""[283][284]","Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[285] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[285] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that ""Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke"".[286]","Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[287]","While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[288] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[289] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's tenth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[290]","Tendulkar's entry into world cricket was hyped up by former Indian stars and those who had seen him play. Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[71] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is ""Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God"".[291] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that ""... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world.""[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said ""I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests.""[292] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said ""I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't.""[293] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[294] Yet, he is the one perceived God-like national figure that unites a nation of many religions.[295]","There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[296] Sudhir Kumar Chaudhary, a fan of Tendulkar from Bihar, has followed almost all the matches played by Sachin since 2003 and has sacrificed his personal life to watch Sachin's play.[297]","At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to ""wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night"".[286] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[298] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.[299]","Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs.[1] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals).[5] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago.[300][301][302]","He also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both Tests (51) and ODIs (49) as well as in Tests and ODIs combined (100). On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. It came against Bangladesh in the league matches of Asia Cup 2012.[303] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,[304] and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined.[citation needed] He also holds the world record for playing the highest number of Test matches (200)[305] and ODI matches (463).[306] Tendulkar has been part of most wins by an Indian in both Test cricket with 72 wins and ODIs with 234 wins and is third in the world in ODI victories after Ricky Ponting (262 wins), Mahela Jayawardene (241 wins).[307][308]","Tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals.[306] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.[218][219][220]","He has been Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and Man of the Series four times, out of them twice in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.[309] The performances earned him respect from Australian cricket fans and players.[71] Similarly he has been Man of the Match 62 times in One day International matches and Man of the Series 15 times.[306] He became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in Test cricket,[citation needed] having also been the third batsman and the first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game.[310] He was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals,[311] and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in ODI cricket history.[citation needed] In the fourth Test of the 2008–09 Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Nagpur on 6 November 2008, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most number of times in Test cricket history,[312] and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries against Australia, tying with Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.[313] On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.[314]","Tendulkar has consistently done well in Cricket World Cups. Tendulkar was the highest run scorer of the 1996 Cricket World Cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 Cricket World Cup with 673 runs.[315] After his century against England during group stages of 2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in Cricket World Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.[316][317]","On 24 May 1995,[336] at the age of 22, Tendulkar married Anjali, a paediatrician and daughter of Gujarati industrialist Anand Mehta and British social worker Annabel Mehta. Sachin's father-in-law, Anand Mehta, is a seven-time national bridge champion.[337] Anjali is six years his senior.[338] His wife Anjali said in an interview that she first met him at the Mumbai airport when he returned from his first tour of England in 1990, after scoring his maiden Test ton and when she was there to pick up her mother and Sachin was arriving with the Indian team. They had a courtship of five years and had got engaged in 1994 in New Zealand.[339] They have two children, Sara (born 12 October 1997) and Arjun (born 24 September 1999). Arjun, a left handed batsman and left arm seamer, has recently been included in under-14 probables list of Mumbai Cricket Association for off-season training camp. In January 2013 he was selected in Mumbai under-14 team for the west zone league.[340] In 2015, he became a net bowler for English batsmen, having been a net batsman for India back in 2011 as an 11-year-old.[341]","Tendulkar is a practising Hindu.

He has developed a reputation for his philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to The Players' Tribune as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he tried his hand at acting, appearing in the film Thunderstruck.",,,"Durant was born on September 29, 1988 in Washington, D.C.[2] to Wanda (née Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father re-entered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.[3][4] Durant has one sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.[5] Growing up, Durant wanted to play for his favorite team, the Toronto Raptors,[6] which included his favorite player, Vince Carter.[6] He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area and was teammates with future National Basketball Association (NBA) players Michael Beasley, Greivis Vásquez, and Ty Lawson, the former of whom Durant remains friends with to this day.[7][8] During this time, he began wearing #35 as his jersey number in honor of his AAU coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35.[9]","After playing two years of high school basketball at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year, growing five inches before the start of the season and beginning the year with a height of 6 feet, 7 inches.[10] Prior to the start of the season, he committed to the University of Texas.[11] At the conclusion of the year, he was named the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, as well as the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 McDonald's All-American Game.[12][13] He was widely regarded as the second-best high school prospect of 2006.[14][15]","For the 2006–07 college season, Durant averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game.[2] The Longhorns finished the year with a 25–10 record overall and a 12–4 record in conference.[16] Awarded a fourth seed in the NCAA Tournament, Texas won their first round match-up against New Mexico State but were upset in the second round by USC despite a 30-point and 9-rebound performance from Durant.[17] For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R. Wooden Award,[18] the Naismith College Player of the Year Award,[19] and all eight other widely recognized honors and awards.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Durant was the first freshman ever to win any of the National Player of the Year awards.[26] On April 11, he officially declared for the 2007 NBA draft.[27] His #35 jersey was later retired by the Longhorns.[28]","Durant was selected with the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics.[30] In his first career game, he registered 18 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 steals against the Denver Nuggets.[31] On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[32] At the conclusion of the season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year behind averages of 20.3 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game.[2] He joined Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James as the only teenagers in league history to average at least 20 points per game over an entire season.[33]","Following Durant's debut season, the SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City, becoming the Thunder and switching to new colors blue, orange, and yellow.[34] The team also drafted UCLA guard Russell Westbrook, who would form an All-Star combination with Durant in later years.[35] At the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend, Durant set a Rookie Challenge record with 46 points.[36] By the conclusion of the year, he had raised his scoring average by five points from the prior season to 25.3 points per game,[2] and was considered a strong candidate for the Most Improved Player Award, eventually finishing third in the voting.[37]","During the 2009–10 season, Durant was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game.[2] Behind his play, the Thunder improved their record by 27 wins from the previous year and defied expectations to make the playoffs.[38][39] With a scoring average of 30.1 points per game, he became the youngest NBA scoring champion and was selected to his first All-NBA team.[2][40] In his playoff debut, he scored 24 points in a Game 1 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers.[41] Oklahoma City would go on to lose the series in six games,[42] but the team's performance led sports analysts to label them as an upcoming title contender.[43]","Prior to the start of the 2010–11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately $86 million.[44][45] For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game.[46] Behind his leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference.[47] In the playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.[48]","On February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Durant recorded his first career 50 point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets.[49][50] At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded his first NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.[51] He finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title.[52] Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed.[53] In Game 1 of the first round against the Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining.[54] Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the Finals.[55] For the championship round, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate.[56]","With a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012–13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club.[2][57] Finishing the year with a 60–22 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference.[58] In the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason.[59][60] Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility,[61] averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs,[2] but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games.[59]","In January of the 2013–14 season, Durant averaged 35.9 points per game while scoring 30 or more points in 12 straight games, including a career-high 54 points against the Golden State Warriors.[62][63] In April, he surpassed Michael Jordan's record for consecutive games scoring 25 points or more at 41.[64] The Thunder finished the year with 59 wins and Durant was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player behind averages of 32 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.[65] To begin the first round of the playoffs, he struggled against the physical play of the Grizzlies, converting on only 24 percent of his field goals in Game 4.[66] Through six games, the Thunder trailed the series 3–2, prompting The Oklahoman to dub Durant ""Mr. Unreliable"".[67] He responded by scoring 36 points in a Game 6 victory.[68] Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers before losing to the Spurs in the Conference Finals in six games[69]","Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks.[70] He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans.[71] On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors,[72] returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points.[73] He then sprained his left big toe in late January.[74] On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot,[75] and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery.[76] In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.[2]","To begin the 2015–16 season, Durant and Russell Westbrook reached several historical milestones together, including becoming the first pair of teammates to each score at least 40 points in a single game since 1996, doing so in a win over the Orlando Magic on October 30.[77][78][79] On April 11, Durant scored 34 points against the Lakers, setting an NBA record for consecutive games scoring 20 or more points with 64.[80] For the year, Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game,[2] leading the Thunder to 55 wins and the third seed in the West.[81] In Game 2 of the first round of the playoffs against the Mavericks, he scored 21 points but made just 7-of-33 shots in the worst postseason shooting performance, both by percentage and number of misses, of his career.[82] After defeating Dallas, Oklahoma City moved on to face the Spurs in the second round, falling behind 2–1 to start the series.[81] In Game 4, Durant tied his playoff career high with 41 points in a Thunder win.[83] Oklahoma City eventually defeated the Spurs in six games, drawing a matchup with the record-setting 73-win Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals.[81] Despite going up 3–1, the Thunder were ousted in seven games, with Durant providing 27 points in Game 7.[84]","On July 4, 2016, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Golden State Warriors.[85][86][87] The move was received negatively by the public and NBA analysts, with many comparing the move to LeBron James's 2010 off-season departure from the Cleveland Cavaliers to join the Miami Heat.[88] On July 7, he officially signed with the Warriors on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year.[89][90][91]","On October 25, Durant made his debut for the Warriors in their season opener against the San Antonio Spurs.

and a tibial bone bruise the previous night against the Washington Wizards.[107] On April 8, after missing 19 games with the knee injury, Durant returned to action and had 16 points, 10 rebounds and

rebounds in his Golden State playoff debut, as the Warriors defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 121–109 in Game 1 of the first-round series.[109]","In February 2007, Durant received an invitation to the United States national team training camp.[110][111] Despite a strong performance, he was cut from the team when its roster was trimmed to its twelve-player limit.[112] Coach Mike Krzyzewski cited the experience of the remaining players as the deciding factor in making the cut.[112] Durant was finally selected to the national team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and became their leader as other All-Stars were unavailable, a role he downplayed.[113] At the tournament, he led Team USA to its first FIBA World Championship since 1994, earning MVP honors in the process.[114] His final averages for the competition were 22.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in nine games.[115]","At the 2012 Olympics, Durant set the record for total points scored in an Olympic basketball tournament.[116] With averages of 19.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game, he helped the national team go undefeated en route to a gold medal.[115] In the tournament's final game, he led all scorers with 30 points.[117]","Less than a month before the start of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, Durant announced that he would be dropping out of the competition, citing mental and physical exhaustion as reasons for his departure.[118] He rejoined Team USA in 2016 for the Olympics, where he led them to a Gold medal.[119] In recognition of his performances, Durant was named the 2016 co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, along with Carmelo Anthony, for the second time in his career.[120]","Though Durant's height is officially listed as 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m), Durant has stated that he actually stands 6 ft 10 3⁄4 in (2.10 m) barefoot and 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) with shoes.[1] He plays mostly at the small forward position.[2] His career averages are 27.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game.[2] He has earned All-NBA honors six times (2009–14, 2016) and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[2] He has won an MVP Award and finished second in the voting three times,[121][122][123] a trend he has expressed frustration over.[124]","Described as a ""scoring prodigy"" by John Hollinger,[125] Durant regularly finishes as one of the NBA's points leaders and has won the scoring title four times.[2] A strong outside shooter, he is one of only seven members of the 50–40–90 club, and his 2013 campaign was called ""one of the greatest shooting seasons in league history"" by Grantland's Zach Lowe.[126] One of the biggest reasons for Durant's shooting prowess is his seven-foot, four inch wingspan, which helps him get his shot off cleanly over most defenders.[127][128] He is also a strong finisher at the rim, converting on 72.2 percent of shots in the paint in 2012.[125] Early in his career, he was criticized for his slim build, defense, and passing.[129] Over time, he grew as a playmaker, increasing his assist numbers every year from 2010 to 2014.[127] He also showed defensive improvement, with opponents averaging just .62 points per isolation play against him in 2014, the best success rate for defensive players who faced at least 100 isolations that season.[130]","Durant describes himself as a ""high school kid"" and enjoys playing video games in his spare time.[131] He is very close with his mother, Wanda, a relationship that was detailed in the Lifetime movie The Real MVP: The Wanda Pratt Story.[132] A Christian,[133] Durant goes to chapel before every game and has religious tattoos on his stomach,[134] wrist,[133] and back.[135] He owns several properties in the Oklahoma City area and listed his primary residence, located in the affluent Club Villa neighborhood, for sale for $1.95 million in 2013.[136] That same year, he opened a restaurant, KD's Southern Cuisine, in the Bricktown neighborhood and briefly became engaged to Monica Wright, a WNBA player.[137][138][139] In 2016, he was a credentialed photographer for the The Players' Tribune at Super Bowl 50.[140][141]","Durant was formerly represented by agents Aaron Goodwin and Rob Pelinka.[142][143] He left Pelinka in 2013 and signed with the Roc Nation group, headed by Jay-Z.[143][144] Durant has endorsement deals with Nike, Sprint, Gatorade, Panini, General Electric, and 2K Sports.[145] In 2012, he tried his hand at acting, appearing in the children's film Thunderstruck.[146] In 2013, he earned $35 million, making him the fourth-highest-earning basketball player that year.[147] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Durant claimed that, despite his high earnings potential, ""global marketing and all that stuff"" does not interest him.[145]","One of the most popular players in the league, Durant's jersey regularly ranks as one of the NBA's best-selling and he is consistently one of the top All-Star vote-getters.[148][149] He has developed a reputation for his kind demeanor; in 2013, Foot Locker released a series of commercials calling him the ""nicest guy in the NBA"",[150] and he has become a beloved figure in Oklahoma City, known for his ""nice escapades"" toward the Thunder's staff.[151] In 2014, he partnered with KIND snacks and launched StrongAndKind.com to show ""being kind is not a sign of weakness.""[152]","Throughout his career, Durant has participated in philanthropic causes. In 2013, he pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross for the victims of the 2013 Moore tornado.[153] His generosity inspired the Thunder and Nike to match his donation.[154] He is also a spokesperson for the Washington, D. C. branch of P'Tones Records, a nationwide non-profit after-school music program.[155]","In 2017, Durant became involved with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement.[156] On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it.[157][158] In his first vlog, he detailed, ""I'm so excited because I got off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube.""[158] As of April 26, 2017, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 100,000 subscribers and 1 million video views.[157]"

In 2013, he appeared in Kick-Ass 2 as Colonel Stars and Stripes. He retracted support for the film two months prior to its release. He issued a statement via his Twitter account that, in light of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary, ""[N]ow in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence.""[3] Carrey reprised his role as Lloyd Christmas in Dumb and Dumber To (2014).[4][5][6]",,,"Carrey was born in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada,[1] to Kathleen (née Oram; 1927–1991), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey (1927–1994), a musician and accountant.[7][8] He has three older siblings: John, Patricia, and Rita.

In a Hamilton Spectator interview (February 2007), Carrey said, ""If my career in show business hadn't panned out I would probably be working today in Hamilton, Ontario at the Dofasco steel mill."" When looking across the Burlington Bay toward Hamilton, he could see the mills and thought, ""Those were where the great jobs were.""[15]","While Carrey was struggling to obtain work and make a name for himself, his father tried to help the young comedian put together a stage act, driving him to Toronto to debut at comedy club Yuk Yuk's.[16] Carrey's impersonations bombed and this gave him doubts about his capabilities as a professional entertainer. His family's financial struggles made it difficult for them to support Carrey's ambitions.[citation needed]","Eventually, the family's financial problems were resolved and they moved into a new home.[16] With more domestic stability, Carrey returned to the stage with a more polished act. In a short period of time, he went from open-mic nights to regular paid shows, building his reputation in the process. A reviewer in the Toronto Star raved that Carrey was ""a genuine star coming to life"".[17] Carrey was soon noticed by comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who signed the young comic to open his tour performances. Dangerfield eventually brought Carrey to Las Vegas. However, Carrey soon decided to move to Hollywood, where he began performing at The Comedy Store and, in 1982, appeared on the televised stand-up show An Evening at the Improv.[18] The following year, he debuted his act on The Tonight Show.[19]","Despite his increasing popularity as a stand-up comic, Carrey turned his attention to the film and television industries, auditioning to be a cast member for the 1980–1981 season of NBC's Saturday Night Live. Carrey was not selected for the position, although he later hosted the show in May 1996, January 2011, and October 2014.[20][21]",In 1984 Carrey was in the short-lived sitcom The Duck Factory.[22],"From 1990 to 1994, Carrey was a regular cast member of the ensemble comedy television series In Living Color.[citation needed]","1994 was a break-out year for Carrey.

The feature received reasonable reviews, with most criticism aimed at the movie's ""blatant commercialism"", as characterized by Peter Travers.[25] In that same year, Carrey reprised his role as Ace Ventura in Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. Like the original film, it was well received by the public, but heavily criticised by critics. It was a huge box-office success, earning $212 million worldwide in addition to breaking records, with a $40 million opening weekend.[26]","Carrey earned $20 million for his next film, The Cable Guy (1996). Directed by Ben Stiller, the film was a satirical black comedy, in which Carrey played a lonely, menacing cable TV installer who infiltrates the life of one of his customers (played by Matthew Broderick). The role was a departure from the ""hapless, hyper, overconfident"" characters he had been known for. However, it did not fare well with most critics, many reacting towards Carrey's change of tone to previous films.[27] Despite the reviews, The Cable Guy grossed $102 million worldwide.[28]","He soon bounced back in 1997 with the critically acclaimed comedy Liar Liar, playing Fletcher Reede, a successful lawyer who has built his career on lying, regularly breaking promises that he makes to his son Max. Max soon makes a birthday wish that for just that one day, his dad would not be able to lie. Carrey was praised for his performance, earning a second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor.

The Truman Show was a commercial success also, earning $264 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million.[32][33] A Film4 critic stated that the film ""allows Carrey to edge away from broad comedy"", adding that it was ""a hilarious and breathtakingly conceived satire"".[34]","That same year, Carrey appeared as a fictionalized version of himself on the final episode of Garry Shandling's The Larry Sanders Show, in which he deliberately ripped into Shandling's character.

The film received a positive reception, with Desson Thomson from The Washington Post saying of Carrey's approach to the character of Count Olaf,","Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur.[42][43]","That same year, Carrey was inducted into the Canadian Walk of Fame.[44]","In 2007, Carrey reunited with Joel Schumacher, director of Batman Forever, for The Number 23, a psychological thriller co-starring Virginia Madsen and Danny Huston.

Carrey released a statement the following day:","What a terrible shame. It would be easy for me to get in a back room with this man’s lawyer and make this go away, but there are some moments in life when you have to stand up and defend your honor against the evil in this world. I will not tolerate this heartless attempt to exploit me or the woman I loved. Cat's troubles were born long before I met her and sadly her tragic end was beyond anyone’s control. I really hope that some day soon people will stop trying to profit from this and let her rest in peace.[71][72]","In October 2016, White's mother Brigid Sweetman also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey.[73] In this lawsuit, Sweetman's attorney states that Carrey had undergone a test for sexually transmitted infections, and ""purposely hid the results from Ms. White, whom he was intimately involved with, and failed to inform her that he had tested positive for Hepatitis A, HSV (Herpes) I and II, and Chlamydia. To make matters worse, Carrey then proceeded to have unprotected sex with Ms. White with full knowledge that he was STD positive.""[74] Sweetman herself later issued a statement: ""These documents show that Jim Carrey has lied to the media, the public and the court.

After his words, he was criticized for being ""ignorant when it comes to vaccines"" by Arthur Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics, at New York University,[81] and by Jeffrey Kluger, senior writer at Time, who described his anti vaccination statements as ""angry, dense and immune to reason.""[82]","Carrey is a follower and an advocate for the law of attraction.

Asked if she intends to repeat Miranda's success, Sangalo said, ""It would be too pretentious for me to even dream about that parallel. But I would like to follow [in] the steps of Tom Jobim and Caetano Veloso. They are Brazilian artists who are respected all around the world. For me, that will be more difficult to achieve, because I want to be known for the kind of music I sing-[which] doesn't fit the Brazilian standards foreign audiences are used to. I want people to [respect] my musical style.""[10]","Her 2005 album, As Supernovas, received triple platinum certification shortly after its release.

MTV,"MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981,[2] the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as ""video jockeys"" (VJs).[3] In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, particularly high school and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.","In recent years, MTV had struggled with the secular decline of music-related cable media. Its ratings had been said to be failing systematically, as younger viewers increasingly shift towards digital media, with yearly ratings drops as high as 29%; thus there was doubt of the lasting relevance of MTV towards young audiences.[4][5][6] In April 2016, MTV announced it would start to return to its original music roots with the reintroduction of the classic MTV series MTV Unplugged. It was also reported that the series MTV Cribs would be making a return on Snapchat, with fourteen original music-related shows speculated to be in production.[citation needed]","MTV has spawned numerous sister channels in the US and affiliated channels internationally, some of which have gone independent. As of July 2015, approximately 92,188,000 US households (79.2% of households with television) have received MTV.[7]",,,"Several earlier concepts for music video-based television programming had been around since the early 1960s. The Beatles had used music videos to promote their records starting in the mid-1960s. The creative use of music videos within their 1964 film A Hard Day's Night, particularly the performance of the song ""Can't Buy Me Love"", led MTV later on June 26, 1999, to honor the film's director Richard Lester with an award for ""basically inventing the music video"".[8]","In his book The Mason Williams FCC Rapport, author Mason Williams states that he pitched an idea to CBS for a television program that featured ""video-radio"", where disc jockeys would play avant-garde art pieces set to music. CBS rejected the idea, but Williams premiered his own musical composition ""Classical Gas"" on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, where he was head writer. In 1970, Philadelphia-based disc jockey Bob Whitney created The Now Explosion, a television series filmed in Atlanta and broadcast in syndication to other local television stations throughout the United States. The series featured promotional clips from various popular artists, but was canceled by its distributor in 1971. Several music programs originating outside of the US, including Australia's Countdown and the United Kingdom's Top of the Pops, which had initially aired music videos in lieu of performances from artists who were not available to perform live, began to feature them regularly by the mid-1970s.","In 1974, Gary Van Haas, vice president of Televak Corporation, introduced a concept to distribute a music video channel to record stores across the United States, and promoted the channel, named Music Video TV, to distributors and retailers in a May 1974 issue of Billboard.[9][10] The channel, which featured video disc jockeys, signed a deal with US Cable in 1978 to expand its audience from retail to cable television. The service was no longer active by the time MTV launched in 1981.","In 1977, Warner Cable a division of Warner Communications and the precursor of Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment launched the first two-way interactive cable television system named QUBE in Columbus, Ohio. The QUBE system offered many specialized channels. One of these specialized channels was Sight on Sound, a music channel that featured concert footage and music-oriented television programs. With the interactive QUBE service, viewers could vote for their favorite songs and artists.","The original programming format of MTV was created by media executive Robert W. Pittman, who later became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of MTV Networks.[11] Pittman had test-driven the music format by producing and hosting a 15-minute show, Album Tracks, on New York City television station WNBC-TV in the late 1970s.","Pittman's boss Warner-Amex executive vice president John Lack had shepherded PopClips, a television series created by former Monkee-turned solo artist Michael Nesmith, whose attention had turned to the music video format in the late 1970s.[12] The inspiration for PopClips came from a similar program on New Zealand's TVNZ network named Radio with Pictures, which premiered in 1976. The concept itself had been in the works since 1966, when major record companies began supplying the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation with promotional music clips to play on the air at no charge. Few artists made the long trip to New Zealand to appear live.","On Saturday, August 1, 1981, at 12:01 am Eastern Time, MTV launched with the words ""Ladies and gentlemen, rock and roll,"" spoken by John Lack and played over footage of the first Space Shuttle launch countdown of Columbia (which took place earlier that year) and of the launch of Apollo 11. Those words were immediately followed by the original MTV theme song, a crunching rock tune composed by Jonathan Elias and John Petersen, playing over the American flag changed to show MTV's logo changing into various textures and designs. MTV producers Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert used this public domain footage as a concept;[13] Seibert said that they had originally planned to use Neil Armstrong's ""One small step"" quote, but lawyers said that Armstrong owned his name and likeness and that he had refused, so the quote was replaced with a beeping sound.[14] A shortened version of the shuttle launch ID ran at the top of every hour in various forms, from MTV's first day until it was pulled in early 1986 in the wake of the Challenger disaster.[15]","The first music video shown on MTV was The Buggles' ""Video Killed the Radio Star"", originally only available to homes in New Jersey.[16] This was followed by the video for Pat Benatar's ""You Better Run"". Sporadically, the screen would go black when an employee at MTV inserted a tape into a VCR.[17] MTV's lower third graphics that appeared near the beginning and end of music videos would eventually use the recognizable Kabel typeface for about 25 years. But these graphics differed on MTV's first day of broadcast; they were set in a different typeface and included information such as the year and record label name.","As programming chief, Robert W. Pittman recruited and managed a team for the launch that included Tom Freston (who succeeded Pittman as CEO of MTV Networks), Fred Seibert, John Sykes, Carolyn Baker (original head of talent and acquisition),[18] Marshall Cohen (original head of research),[19] Gail Sparrow (of talent and acquisition), Sue Steinberg (executive producer),[20] Julian Goldberg, Steve Lawrence, Geoff Bolton; studio producers and MTV News writers/associate producers Liz Nealon, Nancy LaPook and Robin Zorn; Steve Casey (creator of the name ""MTV"" and its first program director),[21] Marcy Brafman, Ronald E. ""Buzz"" Brindle, and Robert Morton. Kenneth M. Miller is credited as being the first technical director to officially launch MTV from its New York City-based network operations facility.[21]","MTV's effect was immediate in areas where the new music video channel was carried. Within two months, record stores in areas where MTV was available were selling music that local radio stations were not playing, such as Men at Work, Bow Wow Wow and the Human League.[22] MTV sparked the Second British Invasion, with British acts, who had been accustomed to using music videos for half a decade, featuring heavily on the channel.[23][24]","The original purpose of MTV was to be ""music television"", playing music videos 24 hours a day and seven days a week, guided by on-air personalities known as VJs, or video jockeys. The original slogans of the channel were ""You'll never look at music the same way again"", and ""On cable. In stereo.""","MTV's earliest format was modeled after AOR (album-oriented rock) radio; MTV would transition to mimic a full Top 40 station in 1984. Fresh-faced young men and women were hired to host the channel's programming and to introduce music videos that were being played. The term VJ was coined, which was a play on the initialism DJ (disc jockey). Many VJs eventually became celebrities in their own right. The original five MTV VJs in 1981 were Nina Blackwood, Mark Goodman, Alan Hunter, J.J. Jackson and Martha Quinn.[25]","The VJs would record intro and outro voiceovers before broadcast, along with music news, interviews, concert dates and promotions. These segments would appear to air live and debut across the MTV program schedule 24 hours a day and seven days a week, although the segments themselves were pre-taped within a regular work week at MTV's studios.[26]","The early music videos that made up the bulk of MTV's programming in the 1980s were promotional videos (or ""promos"", a term that originated in the United Kingdom) that record companies had commissioned for international use or concert clips from any available sources.","Rock bands and performers of the 1980s who had airplay on MTV ranged from new wave to hard rock or heavy metal bands[27] such as Adam Ant, Bryan Adams, Blondie, Eurythmics,[28] Culture Club,[29] Mötley Crüe, Split Enz, Prince, Ultravox, Duran Duran,[30] Van Halen,[31] Bon Jovi, RATT,[32] Def Leppard,[33] The Police, and The Cars. The channel also rotated the music videos of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, who made a career out of parodying other artists' videos.[34] MTV also aired several specials by ""Weird Al"" in the 1980s and 1990s under the title Al TV.","MTV also played classic rock acts from the 1980s and earlier decades, including David Bowie, Dire Straits (whose 1985 song and video ""Money for Nothing"" both referenced MTV and also included the slogan ""I want my MTV"" in its lyrics), Journey, Rush, Linda Ronstadt, Genesis, Billy Squier, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, The Moody Blues, John Mellencamp, Daryl Hall & John Oates, Billy Joel, Robert Palmer, Rod Stewart, The Who, and ZZ Top; newly solo acts such as Peter Gabriel, Robert Plant, Phil Collins, Paul McCartney, David Lee Roth, and Pete Townshend; supergroup acts such as Asia, The Power Station, Yes, The Firm, and Traveling Wilburys, as well as forgotten acts such as Michael Stanley Band, Shoes, Blotto, Ph.D., Rockpile, Bootcamp, Silicon Teens and Taxxi. The hard rock band Kiss publicly appeared without their trademark makeup for the first time on MTV in 1983. The first country-music video aired on MTV was ""Angel of the Morning"" by Juice Newton, which first aired on MTV in 1981.","During the early days of the channel, MTV would occasionally let other stars take over the channel within an hour as ""guest VJs""; these guests included musicians such as Adam Ant, Billy Idol, Phil Collins, Simon LeBon, and Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran, Tina Turner; and comedians such as Eddie Murphy, Martin Short, Dan Aykroyd, and Steven Wright; as they chose their favorite music videos.","The 1983 film Flashdance was the first film in which its promoters excerpted musical segments from it and supplied them to MTV as music videos, which the channel then aired in regular rotation.[35]","In addition to bringing lesser-known artists into view, MTV was instrumental in adding to the booming eighties dance wave. Videos' budgets increased, and artists began to add fully choreographed dance sections. Michael Jackson's music became synonymous with dance. In addition to learning the lyrics, fans also learned his choreography so they could dance along. Madonna capitalized on dance in her videos, using classically trained jazz and break-dancers. Along with extensive costuming and make-up, Duran Duran used tribal elements, pulled from Dunham technique, in ""The Wild Boys"", and Kate Bush used a modern dance duet in ""Running Up That Hill"". MTV brought more than music into public view, it added to the ever-growing resurgence of dance in the early 1980s that has carried through to today.","In 1984, more record companies and artists began making video clips for their music than in the past, realizing the popularity of MTV and the growing medium. In keeping with the influx of videos, MTV announced changes to its playlists in the November 3, 1984, issue of Billboard magazine, that would take effect the following week. The playlist categories would be expanded to seven, from three (light, medium, heavy); including New, Light, Breakout, Medium, Active, Heavy and Power. This would ensure artists with hit records on the charts would be get the exposure they deserved, with Medium being a home for the established hits still on the climb up to the top 10; and Heavy being a home for the big hits – without the bells and whistles – just the exposure they commanded.[36]","In 1985, MTV spearheaded a safe-sex initiative as a response to the AIDS epidemic that continues to influence sexual health currently. In this light, MTV pushed teens to pay more attention to safe-sex because they were most likely more willing to hear this message from MTV than their parents. This showed that MTV was not always influencing youth negatively. Even though in other aspects, MTV was provocative, they had this campaign to showcase their positive influence on youths and safe sex – a campaign that still is alive today: ""Its Your Sex Life"".[37]","During MTV's first few years on the air, very few black artists were included in rotation on the channel. The select few who were in MTV's rotation were Michael Jackson, Prince, Eddy Grant, Donna Summer, Musical Youth, and Herbie Hancock. The very first people of color to perform on MTV was the British band The Specials, which featured an integrated line-up of white and black musicians and vocalists. The Specials' video ""Rat Race"" was played as the 58th video on the station's first day of broadcasting.[38]","MTV rejected other black artists' videos, such as Rick James' ""Super Freak"", because they did not fit the channel's carefully selected album-oriented rock format at the time. The exclusion enraged James; he publicly advocated the addition of more black artists' videos on the channel. Rock legend David Bowie also questioned MTV's lack of black artists during an on-air interview with VJ Mark Goodman in 1983.[39] MTV's original head of talent and acquisition, Carolyn B. Baker, who was black, had questioned why the definition of music had to be so narrow, as had a few others outside the network. ""The party line at MTV was that we weren't playing black music because of the 'research'"", said Baker years later. ""But the research was based on ignorance ... we were young, we were cutting edge. We didn't have to be on the cutting edge of racism."" Nevertheless, it was Baker who had personally rejected Rick James' video for Super Freak ""because there were half-naked women in it, and it was a piece of crap. As a black woman, I did not want that representing my people as the first black video on MTV.""[40]","The network's director of music programming, Buzz Brindle, told an interviewer in 2006, ""MTV was originally designed to be a rock music channel. It was difficult for MTV to find African American artists whose music fit the channel's format that leaned toward rock at the outset."" Writers Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum noted that the channel ""aired videos by plenty of white artists who didn't play rock."" Andrew Goodwin later wrote, ""[MTV] denied racism, on the grounds that it merely followed the rules of the rock business.""[41] MTV senior executive vice president Les Garland complained decades later, ""The worst thing was that 'racism' bullshit ... there were hardly any videos being made by black artists. Record companies weren't funding them. They never got charged with racism."" However, critics of that defense pointed out that record companies were not funding videos for black artists because they knew that they would have difficulty persuading MTV to play them.[42]","Before 1983, Michael Jackson also struggled to receive airtime on MTV.[43] To resolve the struggle and finally ""break the color barrier"", the president of CBS Records at the time, Walter Yetnikoff, denounced MTV in a strong, profane statement, threatening to take away MTV's ability to play any of the record label's music videos.[43][44] However, Les Garland, then acquisitions head, said he decided to air Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" video without pressure from CBS.[39] This was contradicted by CBS head of Business Affairs David Benjamin in Vanity Fair.[14]","According to The Austin Chronicle, Jackson's video for the song ""Billie Jean"" was ""the video that broke the color barrier, even though the channel itself was responsible for erecting that barrier in the first place.""[45] But change was not immediate. ""Billie Jean"" was not added to MTV's ""medium rotation"" playlist (two to three airings per day) until after it had already reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. A month later, it was bumped up into ""heavy rotation"", one week before the MTV debut of Jackson's ""Beat It"" video. Both videos were played several times a day for the next two months. By early summer, the channel had ceased playing either song. But the impact was permanent as by that point the videos by other black artists such as ""Little Red Corvette"" and ""1999"" by Prince and ""She Works Hard for the Money"" by Donna Summer were in heavy rotation on the channel . When Jackson's elaborate video for ""Thriller"" was released late in the year, which raised the ambition bar for what a video could be, the network's support for it was total; subsequently more pop and R&B videos were played on MTV.[46]","Eventually, videos from the emerging genre of rap and hip hop would also begin to enter rotation on MTV. A majority of the rap artists appearing on MTV in the mid-1980s, such as Run-DMC, The Fat Boys, Whodini, LL Cool J, and the Beastie Boys, were from the East Coast.","Video director Don Letts has a different view of the timeline, saying, ""People often say 'Billie Jean' was the first black music video on MTV. 'Pass the Dutchie' was first. Because they were little and spoke in funny British accents, Musical Youth were deemed as non-threatening, and therefore non-black.""","Regardless of the timeline, many black artists had their videos played in ""heavy"" rotation the following year (1984). Along with Michael Jackson, Prince and Donna Summer, other black artists such as Billy Ocean, Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan, Lionel Richie, Ray Parker Jr, Rockwell, The Pointer Sisters, Kool and the Gang, Diana Ross, Shannon, and Deniece Williams all had videos played in heavy rotation on MTV.","In 1984, the channel produced its first MTV Video Music Awards show, or VMAs. The first award show, in 1984, was punctuated by a live performance by Madonna of ""Like A Virgin"". The statuettes that are handed out at the Video Music Awards are of the MTV moonman, the channel's original image from its first broadcast in 1981. Presently, the Video Music Awards are MTV's most watched annual event.[47]","MTV began its annual Spring Break coverage in 1986, setting up temporary operations in Daytona Beach, Florida, for a week in March, broadcasting live eight hours per day. ""Spring break is a youth culture event"", MTV's vice president Doug Herzog said at the time. ""We wanted to be part of it for that reason. It makes good sense for us to come down and go live from the center of it, because obviously the people there are the kinds of people who watch MTV.""[48] The channel's coverage featured numerous live performances from artists and bands on location. The annual tradition would continue into the 2000s, when it would become de-emphasized and handed off to mtvU, the spin-off channel of MTV targeted at college campuses.","The channel would later expand its beach-themed events to the summer, dedicating most of each summer season to broadcasting live from a beach house at various locations away from New York City, eventually leading to channel-wide branding throughout the summer in the 1990s and early 2000s such as Motel California, Summer Share, Isle of MTV, SoCal Summer, Summer in the Keys, and Shore Thing. MTV VJs would host blocks of music videos, interview artists and bands, and introduce live performances and other programs from the beach house location each summer.[49] In the 2000s, as the channel reduced its airtime for music videos and eliminated much of its in-house programming, its annual summer-long events came to an end.","MTV would also hold week-long music events that would take over the presentation of the channel. Examples from the 1990s and 2000s include All Access Week, a week in the summer dedicated to live concerts and festivals; Spankin' New Music Week, a week in the fall dedicated to brand new music videos; and week-long specials that culminated in a particular live event, such as Wanna be a VJ and the Video Music Awards.[50]","At the end of each year, MTV takes advantage of its home location in New York City to broadcast live coverage on New Year's Eve in Times Square. Several live music performances are featured alongside interviews with artists and bands that were influential throughout the year. For many years from the 1980s to the 2000s, the channel upheld a tradition of having a band perform a cover song at midnight immediately following the beginning of the new year.[51]","Throughout its history, MTV has covered global benefit concert series live. For most of July 13, 1985, MTV showed the Live Aid concerts, held in London and Philadelphia and organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. While the ABC network showed only selected highlights during primetime, MTV broadcast 16 hours of coverage.[52]","Along with VH1, MTV broadcast the Live 8 concerts, a series of concerts set in the G8 states and South Africa, on July 2, 2005.[53] Live 8 preceded the 31st G8 summit and the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. MTV drew heavy criticism for its coverage of Live 8. The network cut to commercials, VJ commentary, or other performances during performances. Complaints surfaced on the Internet over MTV interrupting the reunion of Pink Floyd.[54] In response, MTV president Van Toeffler stated that he wanted to broadcast highlights from every venue of Live 8 on MTV and VH1, and clarified that network hosts talked over performances only in transition to commercials, informative segments or other musical performances.[55] Toeffler acknowledged that ""MTV should not have placed such a high priority on showing so many acts, at the expense of airing complete sets by key artists.""[54] He also blamed the Pink Floyd interruption on a mandatory cable affiliate break.[55] MTV averaged 1.4 million viewers for its original July 2 broadcast of Live 8.[54] Consequently, MTV and VH1 aired five hours of uninterrupted Live 8 coverage on July 9, with each channel airing different blocks of artists.[56]","MTV had debuted Dial MTV in 1986, a daily top ten music video countdown show for which viewers could call the toll-free telephone number 1-800-DIAL-MTV to request a music video. The show would be replaced by MTV Most Wanted in 1991, which ran until 1996, and later saw a spiritual successor in Total Request Live. The phone number remained in use for video requests until 2006.","Also in 1986, the channel introduced 120 Minutes, a show that would feature low-rotation, alternative rock and other ""underground"" videos for the next 14 years on MTV and three additional years on sister channel MTV2. The program then became known as Subterranean on MTV2. Eight years later, on July 31, 2011, 120 Minutes was resurrected with Matt Pinfield taking over hosting duties once again and airing monthly on MTV2.","Another late night music video show was added in 1987, Headbangers Ball, which featured heavy metal music and news. Before its abrupt cancellation in 1995, it featured several hosts including Riki Rachtman and Adam Curry. A weekly block of music videos with the name Headbangers Ball aired from 2003 to 2011 on sister channel MTV2, before spending an additional two years as a web-only series on MTV2's website, until Headbangers Ball was discontinued once again in 2013.","In 1988, MTV debuted Yo! MTV Raps, a hip hop/rap formatted program. The program continued until August 1995. It was renamed to simply Yo! and aired as a one-hour program from 1995 to 1999. The concept was reintroduced as Direct Effect in 2000, which became Sucker Free in 2006 and was cancelled in 2008, after briefly celebrating the 20th anniversary of Yo! MTV Raps throughout the months of April and May 2008. Despite its cancellation on MTV, a weekly countdown of hip hop videos known as Sucker Free still airs on MTV2 through the present day.","In 1989, MTV began to premiere music-based specials such as MTV Unplugged, an acoustic performance show, which has featured dozens of acts as its guests and has remained active in numerous iterations on various platforms for over 20 years.","To further cater to the growing success of R&B, MTV introduced the weekly Fade to Black in the summer of 1991, which was hosted by Al B. Sure!. The show would be reformatted into the better known MTV Jams the following year, which incorporated mainstream hip-hop into the playlist. Bill Bellamy would become the new and ongoing host. The show became so successful it spawned its own Most Wanted spinoff titled Most Wanted Jams.","By the early 1990s, MTV was playing a combination of pop-friendly hard rock acts, chart-topping metal and hard rock acts such as Metallica, Nirvana and Guns N' Roses, pop singers such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, 2 Unlimited, and New Kids on the Block, and R&B groups such as New Edition, En Vogue, Bell Biv Devoe, SWV, Tony Toni Tone, TLC and Boyz II Men, while introducing hit rappers Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer. MTV progressively increased its airing of hip hop acts, such as LL Cool J, Queen Latifah, Salt-n-Pepa, Naughty By Nature, Onyx, MC Lyte, and Sir-Mix-A-Lot, and by 1993, the channel added West Coast rappers previously associated with gangsta rap, with a less pop-friendly sound, such as Tupac Shakur, Ice Cube, Warren G, Ice-T, Dr. Dre, Tone Loc, and Snoop Doggy Dogg.","To accompany the new sounds, a new form of music videos came about: more creative, funny, artistic, experimental, and technically accomplished than those in the 1980s. Several noted film directors got their start creating music videos. After pressure from the Music Video Production Association, MTV began listing the names of the videos' directors at the bottom of the credits by December 1992. As a result, MTV's viewers became familiar with the names of Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, David Fincher, Mary Lambert, Samuel Bayer, Matt Mahurin, Mark Romanek, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, Anton Corbijn, Mark Pellington, Tarsem, Hype Williams, Jake Scott, Jonathan Glazer, Marcus Nispel, F. Gary Gray, Jim Yukich, Russell Mulcahy, Steve Barron, Marty Callner, and Michael Bay, among others.","As the PBS series Frontline[57] explored, MTV was a driving force that catapulted music videos to a mainstream audience, turning music videos into an art form as well as a marketing machine that became beneficial to artists. Danny Goldberg, chairman and CEO of Artemis Records, said the following about the art of music videos: ""I know when I worked with Nirvana, Kurt Cobain cared as much about the videos as he did about the records. He wrote the scripts for them, he was in the editing room, and they were part of his art. And I think they stand up as part of his art, and I think that's true of the great artists today. Not every artist is a great artist and not every video is a good video, but in general having it available as a tool, to me, adds to the business. And I wish there had been music videos in the heyday of The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. I think they would've added to their creative contribution, not subtracted from it.""[58]","Nirvana led a sweeping transition into the rise of alternative rock music on MTV in 1991 with their video for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". By late 1991 going into 1992, MTV began frequently airing videos from their heavily promoted ""Buzz Bin"", such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Nine Inch Nails, Tori Amos, PM Dawn, Arrested Development, Björk, and Gin Blossoms. MTV increased rotation of its weekly alternative music program 120 Minutes and added the daily Alternative Nation to play videos of these and other underground music acts. Subsequently, grunge and alternative rock had a rise in mainstream tastes, while 1980s-style glam bands and traditional rockers were phased out, with some exceptions such as Aerosmith and Tom Petty. Older acts such as R.E.M. and U2 remained relevant by making their music more experimental or unexpected.","They also played lots of hard rock acts such as Pantera, Death and other heavy/death metal acts at the time period.","In 1993, more hit alternative rock acts were on heavy rotation, such as Stone Temple Pilots, Soul Asylum, Rage Against the Machine, Marilyn Manson, Tool, Beck, Therapy?, Radiohead, and The Smashing Pumpkins. Other hit acts such as Weezer, Collective Soul, Blind Melon, The Cranberries, Bush, and Silverchair would follow in the next couple of years. Alternative bands that appeared on Beavis and Butt-Head included White Zombie.","By the next few years, 1994 through 1997, MTV began promoting new power pop acts, most successfully Green Day and The Offspring, and ska-rock acts such as No Doubt, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Sublime. Pop singers were added to the rotation with success as long as they were considered ""alternative,"" such as Alanis Morissette, Jewel, Fiona Apple, and Sarah McLachlan.","By 1997, MTV focused heavily on introducing electronica acts into the mainstream, adding them to its musical rotation, including The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Moby, Aphex Twin, Pendulum, Daft Punk, The Crystal Method, Butthole Surfers and Fatboy Slim. Some musicians who proceeded to experiment with electronica were still played on MTV including Orbital, Madonna, U2, David Bowie, Radiohead, and Smashing Pumpkins. That year, MTV also attempted to introduce neo-swing bands, but they did not meet with much success.","However, in late 1997, MTV began shifting more progressively towards pop music, inspired by the success of the Spice Girls and the rise of boy bands in Europe. Between 1998 and 1999, MTV's musical content consisted heavily of videos of boy bands such as Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, as well as teen pop ""princesses"" such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Lynda Thomas, Mandy Moore, and Jessica Simpson. Airplay of rock, electronica, and alternative acts was reduced. Hip-hop music continued in heavy rotation, through the likes of Puff Daddy, Jermaine Dupri, Master P, DMX, Busta Rhymes, Lil' Kim, Jay-Z, Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill, Eminem, Foxy Brown, Ja Rule, Nas, Timbaland, and their associates. R&B was also heavily represented with acts such as Aaliyah, Janet Jackson, Destiny's Child, 702, Monica, and Brandy.","Beginning in late 1997, MTV progressively reduced its airing of rock music videos, leading to the slogan among skeptics, ""Rock is dead.""[59] The facts that at the time rock music fans were less materialistic, and bought less music based on television suggestion, were cited as reasons that MTV abandoned its once staple music. MTV instead devoted its musical airtime mostly to pop and hip hop/R&B music. All rock-centric shows were eliminated and the rock-related categories of the Video Music Awards were pared down to one.","From this time until 2004, MTV made some periodic efforts to reintroduce pop rock music videos to the channel. By 1998 through 1999, the punk-rock band Blink-182 received regular airtime on MTV due in large part to their ""All the Small Things"" video that made fun of the boy bands that MTV was airing at the time. Meanwhile, some rock bands that were not receiving MTV support, such as Korn and Creed, continued to sell albums. Then, upon the release of Korn's rock/rap hybrid album Follow the Leader, MTV began playing Korn's videos ""Got the Life"" and ""Freak on a Leash"".","A band sponsored by Korn, Limp Bizkit, received airtime for its cover of George Michael's ""Faith"", which became a hit. Subsequently, MTV began airing more rap/rock hybrid acts, such as Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock. Some rock acts with more comical videos, such as Rob Zombie, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Foo Fighters, also received airtime.","In the fall of 1999, MTV announced a special Return of the Rock weekend,[60] in which new rock acts received airtime, after which a compilation album was released. System of a Down, Staind, Godsmack, Green Day, Incubus, Papa Roach, P.O.D., Sevendust, Powerman 5000, Slipknot, Kittie, Static X, and CKY were among the featured bands. These bands received some airtime on MTV and more so on MTV2, though both channels gave emphasis to the rock/rap acts.","By 2000, Sum 41, Linkin Park, Jimmy Eat World, Mudvayne, Cold, At the Drive-In, Alien Ant Farm, and other acts were added to the musical rotation. MTV also launched digital cable channel MTVX to play rock music videos exclusively, an experiment that lasted until 2002.[61] A daily music video program on MTV that carried the name Return of the Rock ran through early 2001, replaced by a successor, All Things Rock, from 2002 until 2004.","Also by 1997, MTV was criticized heavily for not playing as many music videos as it had in the past. In response, MTV created four shows that centered on music videos: MTV Live, Total Request, Say What?, and 12 Angry Viewers. Also at this time, MTV introduced its new studios in Times Square.","A year later, in 1998, MTV merged Total Request and MTV Live into a live daily top ten countdown show, Total Request Live, which would become known as TRL (the original host being Carson Daly) and secure its place as the channel's unofficial flagship program. In the fall of 1999, a live studio audience was added to the show. By spring 2000, the countdown reached its peak. The program enjoyed success playing the top ten pop, rock, R&B, and hip hop music videos, and featuring live interviews with artists and celebrities.","From 1998 to 2001, MTV also aired several other music video programs from its studios in Times Square and on location at various beach-themed locations each summer. These programs included Say What? Karaoke, a game show hosted by Dave Holmes that evolved from Say What?, MTV's earlier program that ran the lyrics of music videos across the screen. TRL Wannabes aired from 1999 to 2000 and featured a selection of music videos that just missed the TRL top ten. VJ for a Day, hosted by Raymond Munns, continued this concept in early 2001. VJ for a Day was an extension of an annual event, Wanna be a VJ, which aired each spring from 1998 to 2000 to select a new VJ to host programs on MTV.","MTV also aired Hot Zone, hosted by Ananda Lewis, which featured pop music videos during the midday time period and was a casual alternative to TRL; it later became MTV Hits. Other programs were Direct Effect, Return of the Rock, MTV Jams, BeatSuite, MTV Soul, and blocks of music videos hosted by VJs simply called Music Television in the spirit of the channel's original purpose.","During the September 11, 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, MTV suspended all of its programming, along with its sister cable channel VH1, and it began simulcasting coverage from JTVNews (the news division of JTV[disambiguation needed], which was acquired by MTV parent Viacom two years earlier) until about 11:00 pm. ET that night. The channels then played a looped set of music videos without commercial interruption until an MTV News special edition of TRL aired on September 14, 2001.","In 2002, Carson Daly left MTV and TRL to pursue a late night talk show on NBC. After his departure, the relevance and impact of Total Request Live slowly diminished. TRL ultimately remained a part of MTV's regular program schedule for ten years. The series came to an end with a special finale episode, Total Finale Live, which aired November 16, 2008, and featured all the show's hosts from over the years, many special guests from the history of the show, and played its last music video, ""...Baby One More Time"" by Britney Spears.[62]","Around 1999 through 2001, as MTV aired fewer music videos throughout the day, it regularly aired compilation specials from its then 20-year history to look back on its roots. An all-encompassing special, MTV Uncensored, premiered in 1999 and was later released as a book.[63][64]","MTV celebrated its 20th anniversary on August 1, 2001, beginning with a 12-hour long retrospective called MTV20: Buggles to Bizkit, which featured over 100 classic videos played chronologically, hosted by various VJs in reproductions of MTV's old studios. The day of programming culminated in a three-hour celebratory live event called MTV20: Live and Almost Legal, which was hosted by Carson Daly and featured numerous guests from MTV's history, including the original VJs from 1981. Various other related MTV20 specials aired in the months surrounding the event.","Janet Jackson became the inaugural honoree of the ""mtvICON"" award, ""an annual recognition of artists who have made significant contributions to music, music video and pop culture while tremendously impacting the MTV generation.""[65] Subsequent recipients included Aerosmith, Metallica and The Cure.","Five years later, on August 1, 2006, MTV celebrated its 25th anniversary. On their website, MTV.com, visitors could watch the very first hour of MTV, including airing the original promos and commercials from Mountain Dew, Atari, Chewels gum, and Jovan. Videos were also shown from The Buggles, Pat Benatar, Rod Stewart, and others. The introduction of the first five VJs was also shown. Additionally, MTV.com put together a ""yearbook"" consisting of the greatest videos of each year from 1981 to 2006. MTV itself only mentioned the anniversary once on TRL.","Although MTV reached its 30th year of broadcasting in 2011, the channel itself passed over this milestone in favor of its current programming schedule. The channel instead aired its 30th anniversary celebrations on its sister networks MTV2 and VH1 Classic. Nathaniel Brown, senior vice president of communications for MTV, confirmed that there were no plans for an on-air MTV celebration similar to the channel's 20th anniversary. Brown explained, ""MTV as a brand doesn't age with our viewers. We are really focused on our current viewers, and our feeling was that our anniversary wasn't something that would be meaningful to them, many of whom weren't even alive in 1981.""[66]","From 1995 to 2000, MTV played 36.5% fewer music videos. MTV president Van Toeffler explained: ""Clearly, the novelty of just showing music videos has worn off. It's required us to reinvent ourselves to a contemporary audience.""[67] Despite targeted efforts to play certain types of music videos in limited rotation, MTV greatly reduced its overall rotation of music videos by the mid-2000s.[68] While music videos were featured on MTV up to eight hours per day in 2000, the year 2008 saw an average of just three hours of music videos per day on MTV. The rise of social media and websites like YouTube as a convenient outlet for the promotion and viewing of music videos signaled this reduction.[69]","As the decade progressed, MTV continued to play some music videos instead of relegating them exclusively to its sister channels, but around this time, the channel began to air music videos only in the early morning hours or in a condensed form on Total Request Live. As a result of these programming changes, Justin Timberlake implored MTV to ""play more damn videos!"" while giving an acceptance speech at the 2007 Video Music Awards.[70]","Despite the challenge from Timberlake, MTV continued to decrease its total rotation time for music videos in 2007, and the channel eliminated its long-running special tags for music videos such as ""Buzzworthy"" (for under-represented artists), ""Breakthrough"" (for visually stunning videos), and ""Spankin' New"" (for brand new videos). Additionally, the historic Kabel typeface, which MTV displayed at the beginning and end of all music videos since 1981, was phased out in favor of larger text and less information about the video's record label and director. The classic font can still be seen in ""prechyroned"" versions of old videos on sister network MTV Classic, which had their title information recorded onto the same tape as the video itself.","Prior to its finale in 2008, MTV's main source of music videos was Total Request Live, airing four times per week, featuring short clips of music videos along with VJs and guests. MTV was experimenting at the time with new ideas for music programs to replace the purpose of TRL but with a new format.[71]","In mid-2008, MTV premiered new music video programming blocks called FNMTV and a weekly special event called FNMTV Premieres, hosted from Los Angeles by Pete Wentz of the band Fall Out Boy, which was designed to premiere new music videos and have viewers provide instantaneous feedback.[72]","The FNMTV Premieres event ended before the 2008 Video Music Awards in September. With the exception of a holiday themed episode in December 2008 and an unrelated Spring Break special in March 2009 with the same title, FNMTV Premieres never returned to the channel's regular program schedule, leaving MTV without any music video programs hosted by VJs for the first time in its history.","Music video programming returned to MTV in March 2009 as AMTV, an early morning block of music videos that originally aired from 3 am to 9 am on most weekdays.[73] It was renamed Music Feed in 2013 with a reduced schedule. Unlike the FNMTV block that preceded it, Music Feed features many full-length music videos, including some older videos that have been out of regular rotation for many years on MTV. It also features music news updates, interviews, and performances.[73] Music Feed is the only current program on MTV's main channel that is dedicated to music videos.","During the rest of the day, MTV also plays excerpts from music videos in split screen format during the closing credits of most programs, along with the address of a website to encourage the viewer to watch the full video online. MTV has positioned its website, MTV.com, as its primary destination for music videos.","MTV again resurrected the long-running series MTV Unplugged in 2009 with performances from acts such as Adele and Paramore.[74] However, unlike past Unplugged specials, these new recordings usually only aired in their entirety on MTV's website, MTV.com. Nevertheless, short clips of the specials are shown on MTV during the AMTV block of music videos in the early morning hours. On June 12, 2011, MTV aired a traditional television premiere of a new installment of MTV Unplugged instead of a web debut. The featured artist was rapper Lil Wayne and the show debuted both on MTV and MTV2. The channel followed up with a similar television premiere of MTV Unplugged with Florence and the Machine on April 8, 2012.[75]","MTV launched 10 on Top in May 2010, a weekly program airing on Saturdays and hosted by Lenay Dunn, that counts down the top 10 most trending and talked about topics of the week (generally focused on entertainment). Dunn also appeared in segments between MTV's shows throughout the day as a recognizable personality and face of the channel in the absence of traditional VJs aside from its MTV News correspondents.[76]","The animated series Beavis and Butt-head returned to MTV in October 2011, with new episodes. As with the original version of the series that ran from 1993 to 1997, the modern-day Beavis and Butt-head features segments in which its main characters watch and criticize music videos.[77]","Sometime in 2012, MTV debuted Clubland, which previously existed as an hour of EDM videos during the AMTV video block. The show has no host, but most editorial content is pushed online by the show's Tumblr and other social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter.","MTV launched a new talk show based on hip hop music on April 12, 2012, called Hip Hop POV, hosted by Amanda Seales, Bu Thiam, Charlamagne, Devi Dev, and Sowmya Krishnamurthy. The show featured hosted commentary on the headlines in hip hop culture, providing opinions on new music, granting insider access to major events, and including artist interviews.[78] Hip Hip POV lasted several episodes before going on hiatus. The show was supposed to return in Fall 2012, but was moved to MTV2 instead, where it was rebranded and merged with Sucker Free Countdown. The new show debuted as The Week in Jams on October 28, 2012.","MTV launched a live talk show, It's On with Alexa Chung, on June 15, 2009. The host of the program, Alexa Chung, was described as a ""younger, more Web 2.0"" version of Jimmy Fallon.[79] Although it was filmed in the same Times Square studio where TRL used to be broadcast, the network stated that ""the only thing the two shows have in common is the studio location.""[80] It's On was cancelled in December of the same year, which again eliminated the only live in-studio programming from MTV's schedule, just one year after TRL was also cancelled.","Shortly after Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, the channel aired several hours of Jackson's music videos, accompanied by live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities.[81] The temporary shift in MTV's programming culminated the following week with the channel's live coverage of Jackson's memorial service.[82] MTV aired similar one-hour live specials with music videos and news updates following the death of Whitney Houston on February 11, 2012, and the death of Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys on May 4, 2012.[83][84]","The channel tried its hand again at live programming with the premiere of a half-hour program called The Seven in September 2010. The program counted down seven entertainment-related stories of interest to viewers (and included some interview segments among them), having aired weekdays at 5 pm with a weekend wrap-up at 10 am ET. Shortly after its debut, the show was slightly retooled as it dropped co-host Julie Alexandria but kept fellow co-host Kevin Manno; the Saturday recap show was eliminated as well. The Seven was cancelled on June 13, 2011. Manno's only assignment at MTV post-Seven was conducting an interview with a band which only aired on MTV.com. Manno is no longer employed with MTV and has since appeared as an occasional correspondent on the LXTV-produced NBC series 1st Look.","Presently, MTV airs sporadic live specials called MTV First. The short program, produced by MTV News, debuted in early 2011 and continues to air typically once every couple of weeks on any given weekday. The specials usually begin at 7:53 pm. ET, led by one of MTV News' correspondents who will conduct a live interview with a featured artist or actor who has come to MTV to premiere a music video or movie trailer. MTV starts its next scheduled program at 8:00 pm, while the interview and chat with fans continues on MTV.com for another 30 to 60 minutes. Since its debut in 2011, MTV First has featured high-profile acts such as Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Usher and Justin Bieber. In the absence of daily live programs such as TRL, It's on with Alexa Chung and The Seven to facilitate such segments, the channel now uses MTV First as its newest approach to present music video premieres and bring viewers from its main television channel to its website for real-time interaction with artists and celebrities.[85][86][87][88]","On April 21, 2016, MTV announced that new Unplugged episodes will begin airing as well as a weekly performance series called ""Wonderland"".[89] On that same day, immediately after the death of Prince, MTV interrupted its usual programming to air Prince's music videos.[90][91] During this Marathon, MTV accidentally aired the music video to Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble by DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince[92]","On August 1, 2016, the 35th anniversary of the original MTV's launch, VH1 Classic was rebranded as MTV Classic. The channel's programming focused on classic music videos and programming (including notable episodes of MTV Unplugged and VH1 Storytellers), but skews more towards the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The network aired encores of 2000s MTV series such as Beavis and Butt-Head and Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. The network's relaunch included a broadcast of MTV's first hour on the air, which was also simulcast on MTV and online via Facebook live streaming.[93][94] MTV Classic only retained three original VH1 Classic programs, which were That Metal Show, Metal Evolution and Behind the Music Remastered, although repeats of current and former VH1 programs such as Pop-Up Video and VH1 Storytellers remained on the schedule. However, the rebranded MTV Classic had few viewers, and declined quickly to become the least-watched English-language cable network rated by Nielsen at the end of 2016. At the start of 2017 it was re-programmed into an all-video network.[95][96]","As MTV expanded, music videos were no longer the centerpiece of its programming. Conventional television shows came to replace the VJ-guided music video programming. Today, MTV presents a wide variety of non-music-related television shows aimed primarily at the 12- to 18-year-old demographic.","In 1985, Viacom bought Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which owned MTV and Nickelodeon, renaming the company MTV Networks and beginning this expansion. Before 1987, MTV featured almost exclusively music videos, but as time passed, they introduced a variety of other shows, including some that were originally intended for other channels.","Non-music video programming began in the late 1980s, with the introduction of a music news show The Week in Rock, which was also the beginning of MTV's news division, MTV News. Around this time, MTV also introduced a fashion news show, House of Style; a dance show, Club MTV; and a game show, Remote Control. Programs like these did not feature music videos, but they were still largely based around the world of music.","Following the success of the MTV Video Music Awards, in an effort to branch out from music into movies and broader pop culture, MTV started the MTV Movie Awards in 1992, which continues presently. MTV also created an award show for Europe after the success of the Video Music Awards. The MTV Europe Music Awards, or the EMAs, were created in 1994, ten years after the debut of the VMAs.","These new shows would be just the beginning of new genres of shows to make an impact on MTV. As the format of the network continued to evolve, more genres of shows began to appear. In the early 1990s, MTV debuted its first reality shows, The Real World and Road Rules.","During the latter half of the 1990s and early 2000s, MTV placed a stronger focus on reality shows and related series, building on the success of The Real World and Road Rules. The first round of these shows came in the mid-1990s, with game shows such as Singled Out, reality-based comedy shows such as Buzzkill, and late-night talk shows such as The Jon Stewart Show and Loveline.","The next round of these shows came in approximately the late 1990s, as MTV shifted its focus to prank/comedic shows such as The Tom Green Show and Jackass, and game shows such as Real World/Road Rules Challenge, The Blame Game, webRIOT, and Say What? Karaoke. A year later, in 2000, MTV's Fear became one of the first scare-based reality shows and the first reality show in which contestants filmed themselves.","MTV continued to experiment with late night talk shows in the early 2000s with relatively short-lived programs such as Kathy's So-Called Reality, starring Kathy Griffin, and The New Tom Green Show.","Some of the reality shows on the network also followed the lives of musicians. The Osbournes, a reality show based on the everyday life of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, his wife Sharon, and two of their children, Jack and Kelly, premiered on MTV in 2002. The show went on to become one of the network's biggest-ever successes and was also recognized for the Osbourne family members' heavy use of profanity, which MTV censored for broadcast.[97] It also kick-started a musical career for Kelly Osbourne,[98] while Sharon Osbourne went on to host her own self-titled talk show on US television.[99] Production ended on The Osbournes in November 2004.[100] In the fall of 2004, Ozzy Osbourne's reality show Battle for Ozzfest aired; the show hosted competitions between bands vying to play as part of Ozzfest, a yearly heavy metal music tour across the United States hosted by Osbourne.","In 2003, MTV added Punk'd, a project by Ashton Kutcher to play pranks on various celebrities, and Pimp My Ride, a show about adding aesthetic and functional modifications to cars and other vehicles. Another show was Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, a reality series that followed the lives of pop singers Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, a music celebrity couple. It began in 2003 and ran for four seasons, ending in early 2005; the couple later divorced. The success of Newlyweds was followed in June 2004 by The Ashlee Simpson Show, which documented the beginnings of the music career of Ashlee Simpson, Jessica Simpson's younger sister.","In 2005 and 2006, MTV continued its focus on reality shows, with the debuts of shows such as 8th & Ocean, Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, Next, The Hills, Two-A-Days, My Super Sweet 16, Parental Control, and Viva La Bam, featuring Bam Margera.","In 2007, MTV aired the reality show A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila, chronicling MySpace sensation Tila Tequila's journey to find a companion. Her bisexuality played into the series – both male and female contestants were vying for love – and was the subject of criticism.[101] It was the #2 show airing on MTV at that time, behind The Hills.[102] A spin-off series from A Shot at Love, titled That's Amoré!, followed a similar pursuit from previous A Shot at Love contestant Domenico Nesci.","MTV also welcomed Paris Hilton to its lineup in October 2008, with the launch of her new reality series, Paris Hilton's My New BFF.[103] In 2009, MTV aired Snoop Dogg's second program with the channel, Dogg After Dark, and the show College Life, based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.","In late 2009, MTV shifted its focus back to Real World-style reality programming with the premiere of Jersey Shore, a program that brought high ratings to the channel and also caused controversy due to some of its content.[104]","With backlash towards what some consider too much superficial content on the network, a 2009 New York Times article also stated the intention of MTV to shift its focus towards more socially conscious media, which the article labels ""MTV for the Obama era.""[105] Shows in that vein included T.I.'s Road to Redemption and Fonzworth Bentley's finishing school show From G's to Gents.","The channel also aired a new show around this time titled 16 and Pregnant, which documented the lives of teenagers expecting babies. This had a follow-up show after the first season titled Teen Mom, which follows some of the teens through the first stages with their newborns.","MTV found further success with The Buried Life, a program about four friends traveling across the country to check off a list of ""100 things to do before I die"" and helping others along the way. Another recent reality program is MTV's Hired, which follows the employment interviewing process; candidates meet with career coach Ryan Kahn from University of Dreams and at the end of each episode one candidate lands the job of their dreams.[106][107]","In 2011, MTV premiered an amateur video clip show Ridiculousness, in the vein of Tosh.0 on Comedy Central. In 2012, Punk'd returned with a revolving door of new hosts per episode. Meanwhile, spin-offs from Jersey Shore such as The Pauly D Project and Snooki & JWoww were produced.","MTV announced plans to re-enter the late-night comedy space in 2012, with Nikki & Sara Live, an unscripted series by comedians Nikki Glaser and Sara Schaefer. The program is slated to be aired weekly from MTV's studios in Times Square.[108]","In a continuing bid to become a more diverse network focusing on youth and culture as well as music, MTV added animated shows to its lineup in the early 1990s. The animation showcase Liquid Television (a co-production between BBC and MTV produced in San Francisco by Colossal Pictures) was one of the channel's first programs to focus on the medium. In addition to airing original shows created specifically for MTV, the channel also occasionally aired episodes of original cartoon series produced by sister channel Nickelodeon (Nicktoons) in the early 1990s.","MTV has a history of cartoons with mature themes including Beavis and Butt-Head, Æon Flux, The Brothers Grunt, Celebrity Deathmatch, Undergrads, Clone High, and Daria. Although the channel has gone on to debut many other animated shows, few of MTV's other cartoon series have been renewed for additional seasons, regardless of their reception.","In September 2009, the channel aired Popzilla, which showcased and imitated celebrities in an animated form. MTV again reintroduced animated programming to its lineup with the return of Beavis and Butt-Head in 2011 after 14 years off the air, alongside brand new animated program Good Vibes.","MTV has a long history of airing both comedy and drama programs with scripted or improvised premises. Examples from the 1990s and 2000s include sketch-based comedies such as Just Say Julie, The Ben Stiller Show, The State, The Jenny McCarthy Show, The Lyricist Lounge Show, and Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, as well as soap operas such as Undressed and Spyder Games.","The channel expanded its programming focus in late 2000s and early 2010s to include more scripted programs.[109] The resurgence of scripted programming on MTV saw the introduction of comedy shows such as Awkward. and The Hard Times of RJ Berger, and dramas such as Skins and Teen Wolf. In June 2012, MTV confirmed that it would develop a series based on the Scream franchise.[110]","In recent years, MTV has re-aired other programs from other Viacom-owned networks, such as BET's College Hill, and VH1 programs I Love New York and Flavor of Love.[111] Other programs from non-Viacom networks include reruns of the shows Fastlane (from Fox),[112] Life As We Know It (from ABC),[113] Scrubs (from ABC and NBC), and CW programs America's Next Top Model, Beauty and the Geek,[114] and Hidden Palms.","MTV also began showing movies targeted toward the young adult demographic, including 8 Mile,[115] My Boss's Daughter, Shaun of the Dead, and Napoleon Dynamite (the latter of which the network had a hand in producing). The channel has also broadcast several of its own films from its production division MTV Films, such as Crossroads and Jackass: The Movie,[116] and airs original made-for-television movies from MTV Studios such as Super Sweet 16: The Movie.","In 2010, a study by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation found that of 207.5 hours of prime time programming on MTV, 42% included content reflecting the lives of gay, bisexual and transgender people. This was the highest in the industry and the highest percentage ever.[117]","MTV's now-iconic logo was designed in 1981 by Manhattan Design (a collective formed by Frank Olinsky,[118] Pat Gorman and Patty Rogoff) under the guidance of original creative director Fred Seibert. The block letter ""M"" was sketched by Rogoff, with the scribbled word ""TV"" spraypainted by Olinksky.[119] The primary variant of MTV's logo at the time had the ""M"" in yellow and the ""TV"" in red. But unlike most television networks' logos at the time, the logo was constantly branded with different colors, patterns and images on a variety of station IDs. The only constant aspects of MTV's logo at the time were its general shape and proportions, with everything else being dynamic.[120]","MTV launched on August 1, 1981, with an extended network ID featuring the first landing on the moon (with still images acquired directly from NASA), which was a concept of Seibert's executed by Buzz Potamkin and Perpetual Motion Pictures.[121] The ID then cut to the American flag planted on the moon's surface changed to show the MTV logo on it, which rapidly changed into different colors and patterns several times per second as the network's original guitar-driven jingle was played for the first time. After MTV's launch, the ""moon landing"" ID was edited to show only its ending, and was shown at the top of every hour until early 1986, when the ID was scrapped in light of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. The ID ran ""more than 15,000 times each year"" according to Seibert.[121]","The channel's iconic ""I want my MTV!"" advertising campaign was launched in 1982. It was developed by George Lois and was based on a cereal commercial from the 1950s with the slogan ""I want my Maypo!"" that George created.[122] The campaign featured popular artists and celebrities, including Pete Townshend, Pat Benatar, Adam Ant, David Bowie, The Police, Kiss, Culture Club, Billy Idol, Hall & Oates, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Lionel Richie, Ric Ocasek, John Mellencamp, Peter Wolf, Joe Elliot, Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield and Mick Jagger, interacting with the MTV logo on-air and encouraging viewers to call their cable or satellite providers and request that MTV be added to their local channel lineups.[120] Eventually, the slogan became so ubiquitous that it made an appearance as a lyric sung by Sting on the Dire Straits song ""Money for Nothing"", whose music video aired in regular rotation on MTV when it was first released in 1985.","From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, MTV updated its on-air appearance at the beginning of every year and each summer, creating a consistent brand across all of its music-related shows. This style of channel-wide branding came to an end as MTV drastically reduced its number of music-related shows in the early to mid 2000s. Around this time, MTV introduced a static and single color digital on-screen graphic to be shown during all of its programming.","Starting with the premiere of the short-lived program FNMTV in 2008, MTV started using a revised and chopped down version of its original logo during most of its on-air programming. It became MTV's official logo on February 8, 2010 and officially debuted on its website.[123] The channel's full name ""Music Television"" was officially dropped,[124] with the revised logo largely the same as the original logo, but without the initialism, the bottom of the ""M"" being cropped and the ""V"" in ""TV"" being branched off.[124] This change was most likely made to reflect MTV's more prominent focus on reality and comedy programming and less on music-related programming. However, much like the original logo, the new logo was designed to be filled in with a seemingly unlimited variety of images. It is used worldwide, but not everywhere existentially. The new logo was first used on MTV Films logo with the 2010 film Jackass 3D. MTV's rebranding was overseen by Popkern.[125]","On June 25, 2015,[126] MTV International rebranded its on-air look with a new vaporwave and seapunk-inspired graphics package. It included a series of new station IDs featuring 3D renderings of objects and people, much akin to vaporwave and seapunk ""aesthetics"".[127][128] Many have derided MTV's choice of rebranding, insisting that the artistic style was centered on denouncing corporate capitalism (many aesthetic pieces heavily incorporate corporate logos of the 1970s, 80s and 90s, which coincidentally include MTV's original logo) rather than being embraced by major corporations like MTV. Many have also suggested that MTV made an attempt to be relevant in the modern entertainment world with the rebrand. In addition to this, the rebrand was made on exactly the same day that the social media site Tumblr introduced Tumblr TV, an animated GIF viewer which featured branding inspired by MTV's original 1980s on-air look.[129] Tumblr has been cited as a prominent location of aesthetic art,[130] and thus many have suggested MTV and Tumblr ""switched identities"". The rebrand also incorporated a modified version of MTV's classic ""I Want My MTV!"" slogan, changed to read ""I Am My MTV"". Vice has suggested that the slogan change represents ""the current generation's movement towards self-examination, identity politics and apparent narccism.""[131] MTV also introduced MTV Bump, a website that allows Instagram and Vine users to submit videos to be aired during commercial breaks, as well as MTV Canvas, an online program where users submit custom IDs to also be aired during commercial breaks.[132]","The channel has been a target of criticism by various groups about programming choices, social issues, political correctness, sensitivity, censorship, and a perceived negative social influence on young people.[133] Portions of the content of MTV's programs and productions have come under controversy in the general news media and among social groups that have taken offense. Some within the music industry criticized what they saw as MTV's homogenization of rock 'n' roll, including the punk band the Dead Kennedys, whose song ""M.T.V. – Get Off the Air"" was released on their 1985 album Frankenchrist, just as MTV's influence over the music industry was being solidified.[134] MTV was also the major influence on the growth of music videos during the 1980s.[135]","HBO also had a 30-minute program of music videos called Video Jukebox, that first aired around the time of MTV's launch and would last until late 1986. Also around this time, HBO, as well as other premium channels such as Cinemax, Showtime and The Movie Channel, would occasionally play one or a few music videos between movies.[citation needed]","SuperStation WTBS launched Night Tracks on June 3, 1983, with up to 14 hours of music video airplay each late night weekend by 1985. Its most noticeable difference was that black artists received airplay that MTV initially ignored. The program ran until the end of May 1992.","A few markets also launched music-only channels including Las Vegas' KVMY (channel 21), which debuted in the summer of 1984 as KRLR-TV and branded as ""Vusic 21"". The first video played on that channel was ""Video Killed the Radio Star"", following in the footsteps of MTV.[citation needed]","Shortly after TBS began Night Tracks, NBC launched a music video program called Friday Night Videos, which was considered network television's answer to MTV. Later renamed simply Friday Night, the program ran from 1983 to 2002. ABC's contribution to the music video program genre in 1984, ABC Rocks, was far less successful, lasting only a year.[136]","TBS founder Ted Turner started the Cable Music Channel in 1984, designed to play a broader mix of music videos than MTV's rock format allowed. But after one month as a money-losing venture, Turner sold it to MTV, who redeveloped the channel into VH1.[137]","Shortly after its launch, The Disney Channel aired a program called D-TV, a play on the MTV acronym. The program used music cuts, both from current and past artists. Instead of music videos, the program used clips of various vintage Disney cartoons and animated films to go with the songs. The program aired in multiple formats, sometimes between shows, sometimes as its own program, and other times as one-off specials. The specials tended to air both on The Disney Channel and NBC. The program aired at various times between 1984 and 1999. In 2009, Disney Channel revived the D-TV concept with a new series of short-form segments called Re-Micks.","MTV has edited a number of music videos to remove references to drugs,[138] sex, violence, weapons, racism, homophobia and/or advertising.[139] Many music videos aired on the channel were either censored, moved to late-night rotation, or banned entirely from the channel.","In the 1980s, parent media watchdog groups such as the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) criticized MTV over certain music videos that were claimed to have explicit imagery of satanism. As a result, MTV developed a strict policy on refusal to air videos that may depict Satanism or anti-religious themes.[140] This policy led MTV to ban music videos such as ""Jesus Christ Pose"" by Soundgarden in 1991[141] and ""Megalomaniac"" by Incubus in 2004;[142] however, the controversial band Marilyn Manson was among the most popular rock bands on MTV during the late 1990s and early 2000s.","On September 28, 2016, on an AfterBuzz TV live stream, Scout Durwood said that MTV had a ""no appropriation policy"" that forbid her from wearing her hair in cornrows in an episode of Mary + Jane. She said, ""I wanted to cornrow my hair, and they were like, 'That's racist.'""[143]","During the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony, comedian Andrew Dice Clay did his usual ""adult nursery rhymes"" routine (which he had done in his stand-up acts), after which the network executives imposed a lifetime ban. Billy Idol's music video for the song ""Cradle of Love"" originally had scenes from Clay's film The Adventures of Ford Fairlane when it was originally aired; scenes from the film were later excised. During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Clay was in attendance where he confirmed that the channel lifted the ban.[144]","In the wake of controversy that involved a child burning down his house after allegedly watching Beavis and Butt-head, MTV moved the show from its original 7 pm time slot to an 11 pm time slot. Also, Beavis' insane tendency to flick a lighter and yell ""fire"" was removed from new episodes, and controversial scenes were removed from existing episodes before their rebroadcast.[145] Some extensive edits were noted by series creator Mike Judge after compiling his Collection DVDs, saying that ""some of those episodes may not even exist actually in their original form.""[146]","A pilot for a show called Dude, This Sucks was canceled after teens attending a taping at the Snow Summit Ski Resort in January 2001 were sprayed with liquidized fecal matter by a group known as ""The Shower Rangers"". The teens later sued,[147] with MTV later apologizing and ordering the segment's removal.[148][149]","After Viacom's purchase of CBS, MTV was selected to produce the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show in 2001, airing on CBS and featuring Britney Spears, NSYNC and Aerosmith.[150] Due to its success, MTV was invited back to produce another halftime show in 2004, which would spark a nationwide debate and controversy that would drastically change Super Bowl halftime shows, MTV's programming, and radio censorship.","When CBS aired Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, MTV was again chosen to produce the halftime show, with performances by such artists as Nelly, Diddy, Janet Jackson, and Justin Timberlake. The show became controversial, however, after Timberlake tore off part of Jackson's outfit while performing ""Rock Your Body"" with her, revealing her right breast. All involved parties apologized for the incident, and Timberlake referred to the incident as a ""wardrobe malfunction"".[151]","Michael Powell, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, ordered an investigation the day after broadcast.[151] In the weeks following the halftime show, MTV censored much of its programming. Several music videos, including ""This Love"" and ""I Miss You"", were edited for sexual content.[142] In September 2004, the FCC ruled that the halftime show was indecent and fined CBS $550,000.[152] The FCC upheld it in 2006,[153] but federal judges reversed the fine in 2008.[154]",The Super Bowl itself would not feature another modern act for its halftime show until The Black Eyed Peas performed at Super Bowl XLV in 2011.,"Timberlake and Jackson's controversial event gave way to a ""wave of self-censorship on American television unrivaled since the McCarthy era"".[155] After the sudden event, names surfaced such as nipplegate, Janet moment, and boobgate, and this spread politically, furthering the discussion into the 2004 presidential election surrounding ""moral values"" and ""media decency"".[155]","The Christian right organization American Family Association has also criticized MTV from perceptions of negative moral influence,[156] brutally describing MTV as promoting a ""pro-sex, anti-family, pro-choice, drug culture"".[157]","In 2005, the Parents Television Council (PTC) released a study titled ""MTV Smut Peddlers"", which sought to expose excessive sexual, profane, and violent content on the channel, based on MTV's spring break programming from 2004.[158] Jeanette Kedas, an MTV network executive, called the PTC report ""unfair and inaccurate"" and ""underestimating young people's intellect and level of sophistication"", while L. Brent Bozell III, then-president of the PTC, stated: ""the incessant sleaze on MTV presents the most compelling case yet for consumer cable choice"", referring to the practice of cable and satellite companies to allow consumers to pay for channels à la carte.[159]","In April 2008, PTC released The Rap on Rap, a study covering hip-hop and R&B music videos rotated on programs 106 & Park and Rap City, both shown on BET, and Sucker Free on MTV. PTC urged advertisers to withdraw sponsorship of those programs, whose videos PTC stated targeted children and teenagers containing adult content.[160][161]","MTV received significant criticism from Italian American organizations for Jersey Shore, which premiered in 2009.[162] The controversy was due in large part to the manner in which MTV marketed the show, as it liberally used the word ""guido"" to describe the cast members. The word ""guido"" is generally regarded as an ethnic slur when referring to Italians and Italian Americans. One promotion stated that the show was to follow, ""eight of the hottest, tannest, craziest Guidos,""[163] while yet another advertisement stated, ""Jersey Shore exposes one of the tri-state area's most misunderstood species ... the GUIDO.

Our Guidos and Guidettes will move into the ultimate beach house rental and indulge in everything the Seaside Heights, New Jersey scene has to offer.""[164]","Prior to the series debut, Unico National formally requested that MTV cancel the show.[165] In a formal letter, the company called the show a ""direct, deliberate and disgraceful attack on Italian Americans.""[166] Unico National President Andre DiMino said in a statement, ""MTV has festooned the 'bordello-like' house set with Italian flags and red, white and green maps of New Jersey while every other cutaway shot is of Italian signs and symbols. They are blatantly as well as subliminally bashing Italian Americans with every technique possible.""[167] Around this time, other Italian organizations joined the fight, including the NIAF and the Order Sons of Italy in America.[168][169][170]","MTV responded by issuing a press release which stated in part, ""The Italian American cast takes pride in their ethnicity. We understand that this show is not intended for every audience and depicts just one aspect of youth culture.""[162] Following the calls for the show's removal, several sponsors requested that their ads not be aired during the show. These sponsors included Dell, Domino's Pizza and American Family Insurance.[171] Despite the loss of certain advertisers, MTV did not cancel the show. Moreover, the show saw its audience increase from its premiere in 2009, and continued to place as MTV's top-rated programs during Jersey Shore's six-season run, ending in 2012.","In December 2016, MTV online published a social justice oriented New Year's resolution video telling white men how they could improve themselves in 2017. The video caused widespread outrage online and was deleted from MTV's YouTube channel.[172][173] The video was then reuploaded to their channel, with MTV claiming the new video contained ""updated graphical elements"".[174] The new video quickly received over 10,000 dislikes and less than 100 likes from only 20,000 views, and MTV deleted the video for a second time.[174][175][176]","In addition to its regular programming, MTV has a long history of promoting social, political, and environmental activism in young people. The channel's vehicles for this activism have been Choose or Lose, encompassing political causes and encouraging viewers to vote in elections; Fight For Your Rights, encompassing anti-violence and anti-discrimination causes; think MTV; and MTV Act and Power of 12, the newest umbrellas for MTV's social activism.","In 1992, MTV started a pro-democracy campaign called Choose or Lose, to encourage over 20 million people to register to vote, and the channel hosted a town hall forum for then-candidate Bill Clinton.[177]","In recent years, other politically diverse programs on MTV have included True Life, which documents people's lives and problems, and MTV News specials, which center on very current events in both the music industry and the world. One special show covered the 2004 US Presidential election, airing programs focused on the issues and opinions of young people, including a program where viewers could ask questions of Senator John Kerry.[178] MTV worked with P. Diddy's ""Vote or Die"" campaign, designed to encourage young people to vote.[179]","Additionally, MTV aired a documentary covering a trip by the musical group Sum 41 to the Democratic Republic of Congo, documenting the conflict there. The group ended up being caught in the midst of an attack outside of the hotel and were subsequently flown out of the country.[180]","The channel also began showing presidential campaign commercials for the first time during the 2008 US presidential election.[181] This has led to criticism, with Jonah Goldberg opining that ""MTV serves as the Democrats' main youth outreach program.""[182]",Campaign to motivate young adults to register and vote.,"In 2012, MTV launched MTV Act and Power of 12, its current social activism campaigns. MTV Act focuses on a wide array of social issues,[183] while Power of 12 was a replacement for MTV's Choose or Lose and focused on the 2012 US presidential election.[184]","In 2016, MTV continued its pro-democracy campaign with Elect This, an issue-oriented look at the 2016 election targeting Millennials.

In 1985, MTV saw the introduction of its first true sister channel, VH1, which was originally an acronym for ""Video Hits One"" and was designed to play adult contemporary music videos. Today, VH1 is aimed at celebrity and popular culture programming which include many reality shows. Another sister channel, CMT, targets the country music and southern culture market.","The advent of satellite television and digital cable brought MTV greater channel diversity, including its current sister channels MTV2 and MTV Tr3́s (now Tr3́s), which initially played music videos exclusively but now focus on other programming. MTV also broadcasts mtvU, a college-oriented channel on campus at various universities.","In the 2000s, MTV launched MTV HD, a 1080i high definition simulcast feed of MTV. Until Viacom's main master control was upgraded in 2013, only the network's original series after 2010 (with some pre-2010 content) are broadcast in high definition, while music videos, despite being filmed for high definition presentation, were presented in 4:3 standard definition, forcing them into a windowboxing type of presentation; since that time all music videos are presented in HD when available, depending on director's preference. Jersey Shore, despite being shot with widescreen HD cameras, is also presented with SD windowboxing. Pay television providers such as DirecTV, Dish Network, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, AT&T U-verse, and Verizon FiOS carry the HD channel.","MTV Networks also operates MTV Live, a high-definition channel that features original HD music programming and HD versions of music related programs from MTV, VH1 and CMT.

The third was MTV K, launched in June 2006 and targeted toward Korean Americans. Each of these channels featured music videos and shows from MTV's international affiliates as well as original US programming, promos, and packaging. All three of these channels ceased broadcasting on April 30, 2007.","In the late 1980s, before the World Wide Web, MTV VJ Adam Curry began experimenting on the Internet. He registered the then-unclaimed domain name ""MTV.com"" in 1993 with the idea of being MTV's unofficial new voice on the Internet. Although this move was sanctioned by his supervisors at MTV Networks at the time, when Curry left to start his own web-portal design and hosting company, MTV subsequently sued him for the domain name, which led to an out-of-court settlement.[187]","The service hosted at the domain name was originally branded ""MTV Online"" during MTV's first few years of control over it in the mid-1990s. It served as a counterpart to the America Online portal for MTV content, which existed at AOL keyword MTV until approximately the end of the 1990s. After this time, the website became known as simply ""MTV.com"" and served as the Internet hub for all MTV and MTV News content.","MTV.com experimented with entirely video-based layouts between 2005 and 2007. The experiment began in April 2005 as MTV Overdrive, a streaming video service that supplemented the regular MTV.com website.[188] Shortly after the 2006 Video Music Awards, which were streamed on MTV.com and heavily utilized the MTV Overdrive features, MTV introduced a massive change for MTV.com, transforming the entire site into a Flash video-based entity.[189] Much of users' feedback about the Flash-based site was negative, demonstrating a dissatisfaction with videos that played automatically, commercials that could not be skipped or stopped, and the slower speed of the entire website. The experiment ended in February 2006 as MTV.com reverted to a traditional HTML-based website design with embedded video clips, in the style of YouTube and some other video-based websites.[190]","From 2006 to 2007, MTV operated an online channel, MTV International, targeted to the broad international market. The purpose of the online channel was to air commercial-free music videos once the television channels started concentrating on shows unrelated to music videos or music-related programming.","The channel responded to the rise of the Internet as the new central place to watch music videos in October 2008 by launching MTV Music, a website that features thousands of music videos from MTV and VH1's video libraries, dating back to the earliest videos from 1981.","A newly created division of the company, MTV New Media, announced in 2008 that it would produce its own original web series, in an attempt to create a bridge between old and new media.[191] The programming is available to viewers via personal computers, cell phones, iPods, and other digital devices.[192]","In the summer of 2012, MTV launched a music discovery web site called Artists.MTV. MTV says, ""While technology has made it way easier for artists to produce and distribute their own music on their own terms, it hasn't made it any simpler to find a way to cut through all the Internet noise and speak directly to all of their potential fans.

Beyonce,"Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biːˈjɒnseɪ/; born September 4, 1981)[3][4][5][6] is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw Beyoncé's theatrical film debut in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) and the release of her debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"".","Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child in 2006, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained the top-ten hits ""Déjà Vu"", ""Irreplaceable"", and ""Beautiful Liar"". Beyoncé also continued her acting career, with starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the introduction of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"". Beyoncé took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul.[7] Her critically acclaimed fifth album, Beyoncé (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes. With the release of the widely acclaimed Lemonade (2016), Beyoncé became the first artist to have their first six studio albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.[8]","Throughout her career, she has sold over 100 million records as a solo artist,[9] and a further 60 million with Destiny's Child,[10][11] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[12][13] She has won 22 Grammy Awards and is the most nominated woman in the award's history. She is the most awarded artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, with 24 wins.[14][15] The Recording Industry Association of America recognized her as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s (decade).[16][17] In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s (decade) and awarded her their Millennium Award in 2011.[21] In 2014, she became the highest-paid black musician in history and was listed among Time's 100 most influential people in the world for a second year in a row.[22] Forbes listed her as the most powerful female in entertainment of 2015,[23] and in 2016 she occupied the sixth place for Person of the Year.[24]",,,"Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine ""Tina"" Knowles (née Beyincé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[25] Beyoncé's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name.[26] Beyoncé's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former member of Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had No. 1 albums.[27] Mathew is African American, while Tina is of Louisiana Creole descent (African, Native American, and French).[26][28][29][30] Through her mother, Beyoncé is a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard.[28]","Beyoncé attended St. Mary's Montessori School in Houston, where she enrolled in dance classes. Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.[31] Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's ""Imagine"" to beat 15/16-year-olds.[32][33] In fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir.[34] She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[35] and later Alief Elsik High School.[26][36] Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years.[37]","When Beyoncé was eight, she and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[38] They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[39] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good.[40][41]","In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group.[42] The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments.[26] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[38] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[26] This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.[32]","The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[43] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song ""Killing Time"" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black.[41] The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album,[40] scoring their first major hit ""No, No, No"". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for ""No, No, No"". The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as ""Bills, Bills, Bills"", the group's first number-one single, ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" and ""Say My Name"", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. ""Say My Name"" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[38] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[40] During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song ""After All Is Said and Done"" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.[44]","LeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.[38] Beyoncé experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause.[45] Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time.[46] The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything.[47] Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one would take her seriously.[48] Beyoncé would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it.[47] Franklin was dismissed, leaving just Beyoncé, Rowland, and Williams.[49]","The remaining band members recorded ""Independent Women Part I"", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[38] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[50] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[38] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[51] The album spawned other number-one hits, ""Bootylicious"" and the title track, ""Survivor"", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[52] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[38]","In July 2002, Beyoncé continued her acting career playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[53] which spent its first weekend atop the US box office and grossed $73 million.[54] Beyoncé released ""Work It Out"" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[55] In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding, Jr., in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[56] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S.[57][58] Beyoncé released ""Fighting Temptation"" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[59] Another of Beyoncé's contributions to the soundtrack, ""Summertime"", fared better on the US charts.[60]","Beyoncé's first solo recording was a feature on Jay Z's ""'03 Bonnie & Clyde"" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[62] Her first solo album Dangerously in Love was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[63] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week, debuted atop the Billboard 200,[64] and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide.[65] The album's lead single, ""Crazy in Love"", featuring Jay Z, became Beyoncé's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[66] The single ""Baby Boy"" also reached number one,[61] and singles, ""Me, Myself and I"" and ""Naughty Girl"", both reached the top-five.[67] The album earned Beyoncé a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards; Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for ""Dangerously in Love 2"", Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for ""Crazy in Love"", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for ""The Closer I Get to You"" with Luther Vandross.[68]","In November 2003, she embarked on the Dangerously in Love Tour in Europe and later toured alongside Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys for the Verizon Ladies First Tour in North America.[69] On February 1, 2004, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.[70] After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks.

To see a new side of her is so exciting"".[123] In July 2009, the film was broadcast on MTV.[124][125]","Hilton starred in an MTV reality series, Paris Hilton's My New BFF, about her search for a new best friend;[126] the series premiered on September 30, 2008.[127] That day she introduced her song, ""My BFF"" (the show's theme song), on KIIS-FM with host Ryan Seacrest.[128][129] The series was a hit; 1,200,000 viewers watched the premiere episode, and it averaged a 1.6 rating among viewers 12–34 in its Tuesday 10 p.m. slot (topping all other cable shows in the time slot).[130] Hilton's next project was a Gothic rock musical, Repo! The Genetic Opera.[131] She played Amber Sweet, the surgery- and painkiller-addicted daughter of a biotech magnate. Horror.com said: ""Not only is this by far Hilton's best role, she's actually got a grain of gravitas in the end"".[132] However, Jam! Movies called her a ""hopeless twit as an actress"".[133] Hilton said, ""Just getting a role like this offered to me was new to me because I always get offered a certain role just basically playing myself"".[134] She was nominated for the 2009 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for the role.[135] The film, first screened at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International, began a limited release in the United States and Canada on November 7, 2008.[136] Repo! had ""solid numbers"" for its opening weekend, grossing $51,600 gross in eight theaters.[137][138] Around that time Hilton released her fifth fragrance for women, Fairy Dust,[139] and broke up with Good Charlotte guitarist Benji Madden; they had begun a relationship early that year.[140][141][142][143]","As a result of the American version's success, on January 29, 2009 Paris Hilton's British Best Friend debuted on ITV2 in England;[144] Hilton began to film the show in October 2008.[145][146] The series was successful; its first episode was watched by 428,000 viewers,[147] and 605,000 viewers watched its finale.[148] The second season of Paris Hilton's My New BFF premiered on June 2, 2009. The British series' runner-up, Kat McKenzie, died on July 3, 2009 from a suspected drug overdose.[149] In June Hilton shot Paris Hilton's Dubai BFF,[150] which was finally broadcast in 2011. She appeared in the fifth episode of Supernatural's fifth season.[151][152] In July 2009 Hilton's sixth fragrance for women, Siren, was introduced[153] and she won the Female Celebrity Fragrance of the Year Award at the 2009 Fifi Awards.[154][155] Hilton was involved in the creation of a sunglass line by Gripping Eyewear. She introduced the line on October 7, 2009, and the collection became available in stores in March 2010.[156] The following month, Hilton introduced a hair-and-beauty-products line which included shampoos, conditioners and hair vitamins.[157] That year, she began dating The Hills star Doug Reinhardt;[158] they broke up in April 2010, when she became concerned that he was using her to further his career.[159]","In February 2010 Hilton participated in an advertising campaign for the Brazilian beer Devassa Bem Loura, whose slogan roughly translates into English as ""very blonde bitch"".[160] As part of the campaign, she rode the brewery's float in the Rio Carnival.[161] On July 2, Hilton was accused of smoking marijuana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup game between Brazil and the Netherlands. Although she was escorted from the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium by local police, the case was later dismissed. Her publicist, Dawn Miller, said: ""I can confirm that the incident was a complete misunderstanding and it was actually another person in the group who did it"".[162][163] Two weeks later, Hilton was detained and released after she was caught with cannabis at Corsica's Figari Sud-Corse Airport.[164]","On August 10 Hilton released her 10th fragrance, Tease, which was inspired by Marilyn Monroe.[165] On August 19 she launched a footwear line in Las Vegas, saying about the collection (priced from $60 to $160) in an interview that she ""chose the styling, design, materials and colours for the line and also wanted to make sure it was super comfortable"".[166] That month Hilton was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession in Las Vegas and her boyfriend, Cy Waits, was charged with driving under the influence.[167][168] Hilton's defense initially claimed that the handbag (containing 0.8g of cocaine) was not hers: ""This purse in question was a high street brand – and by no means up to her high fashion standards.""[169] She later claimed personal items (including cash and credit cards) from the bag, acknowledging that it was hers. To avoid a felony conviction, Hilton pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors on September 17, 2010. Under the terms of the plea bargain she was sentenced to one year of probation, 200 hours of community service, a $2,000 fine and the completion of a drug-abuse treatment program.[170][171] Clark County District Attorney David Roger said, ""If she was arrested for anything besides a minor traffic violation she will spend a year in jail. There will be no discussion. The court will have no discretion.""[170] On September 21, 2010, on their way to a Tokyo press conference to promote fashion and fragrance lines, Hilton and her sister Nicky were stopped by immigration officers at Narita Airport because of Hilton's drug-possession conviction the previous day. Under Japan's strict drug laws, travelers convicted of a drug crime are usually denied entry into the country.[172][173] Airport officials questioned Hilton ""for hours"", and she and Nicky were detained overnight at the airport hotel.[172] On September 22 Japanese authorities denied Hilton entry, and she was put on a plane back to the United States. Other stops on their Asian promotional tour were canceled due to Indonesia and Malaysia's anti-drug laws.[173] The critically acclaimed documentary Teenage Paparazzo, in which Hilton appeared, aired on HBO on September 27.[174]","She voiced the character of Bella in the ABC made-for-television film The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation in her first voice-over role,[175] saying: ""I just think it's a really cute film"" and ""I love animal movies, I love Christmas movies, and also, my grandmother, who passed away a couple of years ago from breast cancer, actually had a standard poodle and her name was Paris. So when I'm watching this, it's kind of like watching grandma's dog. It's kind of like a sign to me.""[176] The film aired on November 28, 2010[176] and received good ratings, with 2.611 million viewers.[177] In December 2010, Hilton launched her motorcycle team;[178][179] her Spanish driver, Maverick Vinales, won the final race and finished third overall in the 125cc world championship the following November.[180] She modeled for a second time at the 2011 Brazil Fashion Week (her first time was in early 2010).[181] In February Hilton introduced a fragrance line, the Passport Collection, with perfumes inspired by cities such as Paris, South Beach, Florida and Tokyo.[182] The following month, she introduced a footwear collection in Mexico.[183][184][185] Around that time, she introduced a mobile application which became available for iPhone and iPod touch.[186]","On May 12, 2011, Hilton opened her third store in the Philippines. The store, in the Abreeza Mall in Davao City, featured bags, earrings, wallets, belts, caps and perfumes.[187] On June 1, she returned to reality television in Oxygen's The World According to Paris.[188] The show, which followed her daily life,[189] attracted 409,000 viewers.[190] It was not a success, however, which led to a belief that Hilton's popularity was fading.[191] The New York Times wrote that she ""is an attractive woman with proven talent for marketing and self-promotion, though as a reality heroine she seems a little passé—a Sony Walkman in an iPod era, a Friendster in the age of Facebook or, to put it in context, a single-process blonde in a triple-process world"", also saying that she ""appears to have plenty of boyfriends, present and ex. Paparazzi still snap her picture. But it's hard to see how she can recapture the kind of audience she enjoyed in her heyday—even by streaming her premiere live on Facebook"".[192] Hilton appeared on the show with her boyfriend, Las Vegas nightclub owner Cy Waits,[193] with whom she broke up in June.[194] She was labeled a ""Billion Dollar Entrepreneur"" by Variety magazine, and was featured on its cover.[195][196] Hilton opened her fourth store in the Philippines on August 18, 2011.[197][198][198][199] In September she introduced a footwear line in Istanbul;[200][201] a Paris Hilton store opened in India, with plans for eight more.[202] Hilton modeled for designer Andre Tan during Ukraine Fashion Week in October 2011.","In early 2012 Hilton introduced a new line of sunglasses in Shanghai,[203] calling the launch a ""huge success"".[204] She then debuted as a DJ at a Brazilian pop-music festival,[205][206] introducing her single ""Last Night"" (produced by Afrojack). Although Hilton received negative reviews after her videos were posted on YouTube from DJs Deadmau5,[207] Samantha Ronson[208] and Afrojack,[209] she was praised by DJ Poet,[210] fans and the festival audience.[211] Shortly after her performance, she became a trending topic on Twitter.[212] ""Last Night"" was later given to Pitbull, who included the song on his 2012 album Global Warming with Havanna Brown as the lead singer. Hilton's footwear line was nominated for the Best Celebrity Licensee of the Year award at the 2012 International Licensing Excellence Awards[213] and she released her fifteenth perfume, Dazzle.[214][215][216][217] The socialite appeared in a music video for Korean singer Kim Jang-hoon,[218] which was filmed on Malibu Beach, August 24–25, 2012. An agent for the singer said that several other Hollywood stars were considered for the lead-actress role in Kim's music video, including Jessica Alba and Scarlett Johansson. Hilton was chosen after Korean survey respondents recognized her more than the others.[219] She was reportedly paid $1 million for her appearance in the video,[220][221] which premiered in 3D in October 2012.[222]","On September 20, 2012, an audio recording of Hilton making derogatory comments about gay people was posted on the Internet.[223][224][225] That day, following a backlash, she issued an apology through GLAAD in which she said she was a ""huge supporter of the gay community"" and called gay people ""the strongest and most inspiring people I know"".[226][227] As a result of her remarks, Logo TV canceled plans to air a documentary about her (Paris Hilton Inc).[228][229][230] That month Hilton began a relationship with Spanish model River Viiperi,[231] and opened a store in Mecca in early November. Since it is considered the ""holiest city in the Muslim world"" and Saudi Arabia is a conservative country, controversy about her personal life swirled on Twitter.[232][233][234] In early December she modeled for designers Shane and Falguni Peacock at India Fashion Week,[235][236][237] also appearing as a DJ.[238] Like her debut, although her set was criticized after a YouTube video was posted the audience enjoyed it.[239][240]","In January 2013, Hilton appeared in four episodes of the Danish version of Paradise Hotel, for which she was reportedly paid $300,000.[241] She also appeared in two episodes of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, in which her aunts Kyle and Kim Richards play the leads.[242] In April, Hilton opened the 44th Paris Hilton store in Bogotá, Colombia.[243][244] In May, the music video for Rich Gang's song ""Tapout"", in which Hilton appeared alongside Lil Wayne, Christina Milian and Nicki Minaj, premiered.[245] That same month, it was reported that Hilton had signed with Cash Money Records and planned to release a second album sometime that year[246][247] featuring collaborations with RedOne, Snoop Dogg and Flo Rida.[248] She told Rolling Stone, ""I'm working with so many talented and awesome people for my album and can't wait to share more of the music"",[248] describing the album as ""very eclectic"".[249] The following month, Hilton made a cameo appearance in Sofia Coppola's film The Bling Ring about the infamous group of teenagers who had robbed homes of celebrities such as Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Orlando Bloom.[250] In addition to appearing in the film, she loaned Coppola her house for two weeks of shooting.[251][252] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Hilton said that Coppola liked her house when she went to a birthday party there.[253] Recalling the house, Coppola said: ""It was like we have to get this into the movie. It was so unique. It would be hard to recreate that. She is larger than life and her house is like Paris World.""[254]","During August, Hilton was a DJ at Amnesia's weekly ""Foam and Diamonds"" parties on Ibiza.[255][256] The positive reaction from critics and audiences led to her contract's renewal for 2014.[257][258] In October, Hilton released the first single from her upcoming second studio album, ""Good Time"" featuring rapper Lil Wayne.[259] It debuted at number eighteen on the US Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart.[260] The second single, ""Come Alive"", was released in July 2014.[261] In April 2015, it was reported that Hilton's dog Tinkerbell, who appeared with her in The Simple Life, had died at the age of 14.[262] In May, Hilton's third single from her upcoming second album, ""High Off My Love"", was released. It eventually peaked at number three on the Billboard US Dance Club Songs chart. In January 2016, Hilton's song ""Crazy"" in collaboration with DJ Poet surfaced online.[263]","A fixture in entertainment news for her lifestyle,[264] Hilton attracted notoriety for her participation in 1 Night in Paris (a sex tape leaked before the first episode of The Simple Life).[265] Some entertainment writers felt that Hilton's overnight success was due to the tape.[266] According to Entertainment Weekly, ""I dare say the Paris Hilton-Rick Salomon tape received more print and television coverage in a week than the run-up to The Simple Life received in the months since its premiere was announced. We in the media have become Paris-ites"".[267] According to People magazine, the show ""no doubt was helped by the very public saga of a pirated three-year-old video tape, which recently made the rounds on the Internet showing Hilton engaged in various sex acts with ex-boyfriend Rick Salomon"".[32] Hilton's profile was higher, paparazzi began following her and her relationships, lifestyle and legal issues were targets of gossip sites and tabloid media worldwide. Critics suggest that Hilton epitomizes being famous for being famous,[7] and she is an example of the celebutante.","The socialite ranked 59th, 23rd, 34th and 35th in FHM's 100 Sexiest Women poll in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2012, respectively,[268][269][270] and was 20th and 38th on Maxim magazine's Hot 100 list in 2005 and 2006.[271][272] In a poll conducted by the Associated Press and AOL Hilton was the second-Worst Celebrity Role Model of 2006, behind Britney Spears.[273] Lloyd Grove banned her from his New York Daily News gossip column, and in February 2007 the Associated Press attempted to not mention her for a week.[274] In May Hilton denied calling herself the ""iconic blonde of the decade"", like Princess Diana and Marilyn Monroe, in Harper's Bazaar.[275] She appeared in the 2007 Guinness World Records as the world's Most Overrated Celebrity.[276][277]","In 2009, a quiet relationship between Hilton and the tabloids led entertainment writers to suggest that her popularity had waned. In a CNN story, ""Why has Paris Hilton disappeared?"", editor Samantha Yanks of Gotham and Hamptons magazines said: ""Phase one was the ascension, seemingly out of nowhere. That came with a media frenzy, the antics, the partying, the music, the babe-like status and of course, the fashion label. Phase two, she disappears"".[278] Hilton's absence from the news was an apparent response to a new generation of tabloid consumers uninterested in her.[278] This suspicion was reinforced in June 2011 when her reality show, The World According to Paris, had low ratings and Hilton walked out during an interview with Good Morning America when asked if she worried about her moment having passed.[279][280]","In 2011 Hilton was named one of the 100 Hottest Women of All Time by Men's Health,[281] but according to an Ipsos poll she was the most unpopular celebrity with Americans (with 60 percent of respondents viewing her unfavorably).[282] In 2012 she ranked fifth on Forbes' Most Over-Exposed list; according to the magazine, Hilton ""is another star who hasn't been on magazine covers for a long time. But she was so ubiquitous at one point that the public still views her as overexposed.""[283][284] On the May 2, 2013 episode of The Wendy Williams Show, Hilton addressed her absence from the news, saying that she was ""staying out of trouble"" and had grown up.[285] After her small role in The Bling Ring, writer Nancy Jo Sales said that Hilton was ""enjoying a little comeback"".[286] Shortly after the film's premiere at Cannes, her deal with Cash Money Records made her a trending topic worldwide on Twitter[287] and media outlets have noted 2013 as Hilton's ""pop culture renaissance"" year. Birdman, co-founder of Cash Money Records, said that her deal ""being so talked about shows the strength of her popularity.""[288]","Hilton is listed on the ""First Families"" of the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, which means she has donated US$100,000 or more to the hospital.[289] In 2008, a room at the CHLA was named in her honor.[290]","The catchphrase ""That's hot"" is Hilton's signature line.[291] The catchphrase is also registered as a trademark for products, like clothing apparel, electronic devices, and alcoholic beverages.[291] Hilton appeared in a 2005 television commercial entitled ""Paris Car Wash,"" promoting Carl's Jr.'s Spicy Burger product. The television spot contained a penultimate black screen showing the lines, ""The spicy BBQ burger / That's hot.""[292]","On September 6, 2007, Hilton filed an injunction lawsuit against Hallmark Cards Inc., titled Hilton v. Hallmark Cards, in U.S. District Court over the unlawful use of her picture and catchphrase ""That's hot"" on a greeting card. The card is titled ""Paris's First Day as a Waitress"" with a photograph of Hilton's face on a cartoon of a waitress serving a plate of food, with a dialogue bubble saying ""Don't touch that, it's hot"" (which had a registered trademark on February 13, 2007). Hilton's attorney Brent Blakely said that the infringement damages would be based on profits from the greeting cards. Julie O'Dell said that Hallmark used the card as parody, protected under fair use law.[293] The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reviewed the case and ""denied Hallmark's motion to dismiss"". Hilton and Hallmark Cards Inc. later settled out of court.[294]",Hilton has had two popular television characters loosely based on her real life persona: London Tipton from The Suite Life of Zack & Cody (Tipton's father in the series is a hotel mogul) and Caroline Channing in 2 Broke Girls.[295],"The World of Warcraft massively multiplayer online role-playing game has featured a character named Haris Pilton, labeled a ""Socialite"", since the release of The Burning Crusade expansion on January 15, 2007. The character remains in the game as of April 2015.[296]","In 2006 Hilton licensed her name to Gameloft for their mobile video game ""Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest"". She made an appearance at E3 to promote the game, arriving 90 minutes late and getting the name of the game wrong.[303] In 2015 Animoca Brands, a mobile game developer from Hong Kong, announced that they had secured a license from Hilton to use her name and likeness to produce mobile games and themes.

Ronaldinho,"Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (born 21 March 1980), commonly known as Ronaldinho (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʁonawˈdʒĩɲu]) or Ronaldinho Gaúcho,[2] is a Brazilian professional footballer and current club ambassador for Spanish club FC Barcelona after signing for them in September 2016.[3] His main playing position is as an attacking midfielder or forward. He won the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 2004 and 2005. Renowned for his technique, tricks, dribbling, overhead kicks, no-look passes and free kicks, Ronaldinho is regarded to be one of the best players of his generation.[4][5]","""Ronaldinho"", the lengthened term of endearment for ""Ronaldo"", is accompanied in Brazilian usage by the nickname ""Gaúcho"" (since he hails from southern Brazil), in order to distinguish him from fellow footballer and countryman Ronaldo, who was known as ""Ronaldinho"" in Brazil beforehand. Ronaldo went by his first name upon his move to Europe, thereby allowing Ronaldinho to drop the ""Gaúcho"" and go by the name Ronaldinho abroad.[6]","Ronaldinho has played 97 matches and scored 33 goals for the Brazil national team. He was an integral part of the 2002 FIFA World Cup-winning team in Korea and Japan, starring alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo in an attacking trio, and was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team.","At club level, Ronaldinho played first for the Brazilian club Grêmio before spending the bulk of his career with European clubs Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Milan. He then returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo and Atlético Mineiro before moving to Mexico to play for Querétaro. With Barcelona, he won La Liga twice, the UEFA Champions League in 2006 and accumulated numerous individual awards, including the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2004 and 2005 and the Ballon d'Or in 2005. Ronaldinho was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world's greatest living players compiled by Pelé, and to the FIFPro World XI from 2005–2007.","Ronaldo de Assis Moreira was born 21 March 1980 in the city of Porto Alegre, the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. His mother, Dona Miguelina Elói Assis dos Santos (daughter of Enviro Assis),[7] is a former salesperson who studied to become a nurse. His father, João de Assis Moreira, was a shipyard worker and footballer for local club Esporte Clube Cruzeiro (not to be confused with the larger Cruzeiro Esporte Clube).[8] He suffered a fatal heart attack in the family swimming pool when Ronaldo was eight. After Ronaldo's older brother Roberto signed with Grêmio, the family moved to a home in the more affluent Guarujá section of Porto Alegre, which was a gift from Grêmio to convince Roberto to stay at the club, but Roberto's career was ultimately cut short by injury. Today, Roberto acts as his manager, while his sister Deisi works as his press coordinator.[9][10] Ronaldo's football skills began to blossom at the age of eight, and he was first given the nickname ""Ronaldinho"" because he was often the youngest and the smallest player in youth club matches.[9] He developed an interest in futsal and beach football, which later expanded to organized football. His first brush with the media came at the age of 13, when he scored all 23 goals in a 23–0 victory against a local team.[11] Ronaldinho was identified as a rising star at the 1997 U-17 World Championship in Egypt, in which he scored two goals on penalty kicks.[12][13]","Growing up, his idols included the World Cup winning stars; Rivelino (from 1970), Diego Maradona (from 1986), Romário (from 1994), and his two future international teammates Ronaldo and Rivaldo (which would form the attacking trio in Brazil's 2002 World Cup winning team).[14] Ronaldinho is the father of a son, João, born on 25 February 2005 to Brazilian dancer Janaína Mendes and named after his late father.[15] He gained Spanish citizenship in 2007.[16]","""I've worked with some great players in my time and all at a very interesting period in their careers, nineteen to twenty years old. But, with due respect to the others, Ronaldinho was a cut above the rest.""","Ronaldinho's career began with the Grêmio youth squad. He made his senior side debut during the 1998 Copa Libertadores.[18] 1999 saw the emergence of the 18-year-old Ronaldinho, with 23 goals in 48 matches, and he put in headlining displays in derbies against Internacional, most notably on 20 June 1999 in the Rio Grande do Sul State Championship final.[19] In a match-winning performance, Ronaldinho embarrassed Internacional's Brazilian legend and 1994 World Cup-winning captain Dunga, flicking the ball over his head on one occasion, and leaving him flat-footed in a mazy dribble on another.[19] Ronaldinho achieved further success with Grêmio, winning the inaugural Copa Sul-Minas.[19]","In 2001, Arsenal expressed interest in signing Ronaldinho, but the move collapsed after he could not obtain a work permit because he was a non-EU player who had not played enough international matches.[20] He considered playing on loan with Scottish Premier League side St Mirren, which never happened due to his involvement in a fake passport scandal in Brazil.[21]","In 2001, Ronaldinho signed a five-year contract with French club Paris Saint-Germain in a €5 million transfer.[22] Upon his arrival in Paris, Ronaldinho was given the number 21 shirt and inserted into a lineup that included fellow Brazilian Aloísio, midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha and striker Nicolas Anelka.[23]","Ronaldinho made his league debut for the club on 4 August 2001, appearing as a substitute in a 1–1 draw with Auxerre.[24] Ronaldinho spent the majority of the first few months of the 2001–02 season alternated between the bench and starter's role. He scored his first goal for the club on 13 October in a 2–2 draw against Lyon, converting the equalizing penalty in the 79th minute after having come on ten minutes prior.[25] After returning from the winter break, Ronaldinho went on a tear, scoring a goal in four consecutive matches to open the new campaign. He recorded impressive goals against Monaco, Rennes, Lens and Lorient. On 16 March 2002, he recorded a double in PSG's 3–1 victory against relegation strugglers Troyes.[26] He scored his final league goal of the season in the club's 2–0 win over Metz on 27 April.[27]","Ronaldinho was also influential in the 2001–02 Coupe de la Ligue, helping PSG reach the semi-finals where they were eliminated by Bordeaux. In a Round of 16 match against Guingamp, Ronaldinho scored two second half goals in the game after having entered the match as a half-time substitute. Despite Ronaldinho's initial success with the club, the season was marred by controversy with Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Fernández, claiming that the Brazilian was too focused on the Parisian nightlife rather than football, and complained that his holidays in Brazil never ended at the scheduled times.[18]","Despite repeated rifts with Fernández, Ronaldinho returned to the team for the 2002–03 season, with the player switching to the number 10 shirt. Though his performances in his second season with the club were underwhelming compared to his first, Ronaldinho performed admirably with the club. On 26 October 2002, he scored two goals in PSG's 3–1 victory over Classique rivals Marseille. The first goal was a free kick, which curled past numerous Marseille players in the 18-yard box before sailing past goalkeeper Vedran Runje. In the return match, he again scored in PSG's 3–0 victory at the Stade Vélodrome, running half the length of the field before flicking the ball over the goalkeeper.[28]","Ronaldinho was also praised for his performance in the Coupe de France when he scored both goals in the club's 2–0 win over Bordeaux in the semi-finals, which inserted PSG into the final. After scoring his first goal in the 22nd minute, Ronaldinho capped the game in the 81st minute, accurately chipping the ball at the 18-yard box over the head of goalkeeper Ulrich Ramé, despite Ramé being in a favorable position. For his performance, Ronaldinho was given a standing ovation by the Parisian supporters. Unfortunately for the club, however, Ronaldinho and the team failed to capture the form that got them to the final as they bowed out 2–1 to Auxerre due to a last minute goal from Jean-Alain Boumsong. Despite Ronaldinho's performances, the club finished in a disappointing 11th-placed position. Following the season, Ronaldinho declared he wanted to leave the club after the capital club failed to qualify for any European competition.[29]","""Ronaldinho was responsible for the change in Barça. It was a bad time and the change that came about with his arrival was amazing.""","FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta had promised to bring David Beckham to the club, but following his transfer to Real Madrid, Barcelona entered the running for Ronaldinho and outbid Manchester United for his signature in a €30 million deal.[31][32]","Ronaldinho made his team debut in a friendly against Milan at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., scoring one goal in a 2–0 victory. He scored his first goal in the La Liga on 3 September 2003 against Sevilla.[33] After receiving the ball from his goalkeeper inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran through midfield and dribbled past two Sevilla players before striking the ball from 30 yards which hammered off the underside of the crossbar and back up into the roof of the net.[33] Ronaldinho suffered from injury during the first half of the campaign,[34] and Barcelona slumped to 12th in the league standings midway through the season. Ronaldinho returned from injury and scored 15 goals in La Liga during the 2003–04 season, helping the team ultimately finish second in the league.[35][36]","Ronaldinho won his first league title in 2004–05, and was named FIFA World Player of the Year on 20 December 2004.[37] His fame was growing with his entertaining and productive play in both the La Liga and the UEFA Champions League. On 8 March 2005, Barcelona were eliminated from the latter competition by Chelsea in the first knockout round, losing 5–4 over two legs.[38] Ronaldinho scored both goals in the 4–2 second leg loss in London, the second a spectacular strike where he feinted to shoot before striking the ball with no back-lift past Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech from 20 yards out.[38]","With his contract expiring in 2008, Ronaldinho was offered an extension until 2014 that would have net him £85 million over nine years,[39] but he turned it down. In September 2005, he signed a two-year extension that contained a minimum-fee release clause that allowed him to leave should a club make an offer to Barcelona of at least £85 million for him.[40]","By the end of the year 2005, Ronaldinho had started to accumulate a host of personal awards. He won the inaugural FIFPro World Player of the Year in September 2005, in addition to being included in the 2005 FIFPro World XI, and being named the 2005 European Footballer of the Year. Also that year, Ronaldinho was voted the FIFA World Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[37] He became only the third player to win the award more than once, after three-time winners Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane.[37] His domination as the world's best footballer was undisputed as he also won the prestigious Ballon d'Or for the only time in his career.[41]","On 19 November, Ronaldinho scored twice as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3–0 on the road in the first leg of El Clásico. After he sealed the match with his second goal, Madrid fans paid homage to his performance by applauding, so rare a tribute only Diego Maradona had ever been granted previously as a Barcelona player at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[42] Ronaldinho stated, ""I will never forget this because it is very rare for any footballer to be applauded in this way by the opposition fans.""[42]","""He transmits a lot of joy and pleasure playing the game, and he has individual skills that are of such a high level that everybody in the world adores him.""","The season is considered one of the best in Ronaldinho's career as he was an instrumental part of Barcelona's first Champions League title in 14 years. After winning their group convincingly, Barcelona faced Chelsea in the round of 16 for a rematch of the previous year.[44] Ronaldinho scored a decisive goal in the second leg, going past three Chelsea defenders on the edge of the penalty area before beating the goalkeeper, sealing Barcelona's qualification to the next round.[44] He also contributed one goal in Barcelona's elimination of Benfica in the quarter-finals with a 2–0 home victory. After a 1–0 semifinal aggregate win over Milan, in which Ronaldinho assisted the series' only goal by Ludovic Giuly, Barcelona progressed to the Champions League final, which they won on 17 May 2006 with a 2–1 defeat of Arsenal.[45] Two weeks earlier, Barcelona had clinched their second-straight La Liga title with a 1–0 win over Celta de Vigo, giving Ronaldinho his first career double.[46]","Ronaldinho finished the season with a career-best 26 goals, including seven in the Champions League, and was chosen for the UEFA Team of the Year for the third consecutive time and was named the 2005–06 UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[35] He was named in the six man shortlist for the 2006 Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, and was selected in the FIFA World XI.[47]","""When you play with him and see what he does with a ball, nothing surprises me any more. One of these days, he will make the ball talk.""","On 25 November 2006, Ronaldinho scored his 50th career league goal against Villarreal, then later scored a second time with an overhead bicycle kick. He later said to reporters that the latter was a goal he had dreamed of scoring since he was a boy.[49] He scored once and set up two others in Barcelona's 4–0 Club World Cup win over Mexico's Club América on 14 December,[50] but Barcelona were defeated 1–0 by Brazilian club Internacional in the final. Ronaldinho was the recipient of the Bronze Ball Award for the competition.","The next day, Ronaldinho finished third in the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year, behind 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro and Zinedine Zidane.[51] Ronaldinho was forced to miss a charity match on 13 March due to an injury he had picked up several days earlier in Barcelona's 3–3 El Clásico draw with Real Madrid.[52] Although Ronaldinho scored his career-best 21 league goals, the team lost the title to Real with a worse head-to-head record, as both teams finished the season with the same number of points.[35][53]","Ronaldinho played his 200th career match for Barcelona in a league match against Osasuna on 3 February 2008. His 2007–08 campaign as a whole, however, was plagued by injuries, and a muscle tear in his right leg on 3 April prematurely ended his season.[54] Having been a model professional and devoted himself to training during his hugely successful first three seasons at Barcelona, Ronaldinho's partying lifestyle and lack of dedication to training saw his physical condition decline, with many at the club believing he was now past his prime.[55][56] On 19 May 2008, Barcelona club president Joan Laporta stated that Ronaldinho needed a ""new challenge"", claiming that he needed a new club if he were to revive his career.[57]",Ronaldinho joined Barca as a toothy-grinned wizard who had the club under his spell for three glorious seasons. He will leave a rather forlorn figure. Whether his magic has been exhausted or he just needs a new challenge remains to be seen.,"Ronaldinho and Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi each captained a team of international stars in an anti-racism exhibition match in Venezuela on 28 June, which ended in a 7–7 draw. Ronaldinho finished with a pair of goals and two assists in what would be his last match as a Barcelona player.[59] In preparation for the 2010 Joan Gamper Trophy, Ronaldinho sent an open letter to the fans and players of Barcelona, stating that his best years had been the five he spent in the Catalan club.[60] It was a sad moment for him and he later said in an interview that he regretted leaving without playing long enough with Messi.[61]","In July 2008, Ronaldinho turned down a £25.5 million offer from Manchester City of the Premier League to join Italian Serie A giants Milan on a three-year contract thought to be worth around £5.1 million (€6.5 million) a year, for €22.05 million plus €1.05 million bonus each season (€24.15 million in 2010).[62][63][64][65] With the number 10 already occupied by teammate Clarence Seedorf, he selected 80 as his jersey number.",Ronaldinho scored his first goal for Milan in a 1–0 derby victory over rival Internazionale on 28 September 2008. His first brace was in a 3–0 win over Sampdoria on 19 October 2008. He scored a 93rd-minute match-winner against Braga in the UEFA Cup group stage on 6 November.[55],"Ronaldinho finished the 2008–09 season at Milan with 10 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions. After a good start to the season, Ronaldinho struggled with fitness, and was often played from the bench to end a disappointing first season for Milan.[55] A perceived lack of dedication in training and a lifestyle of late night partying not befitting of an athlete saw him receive criticism, with Carlo Ancelotti, his coach at Milan in his first season in Italy, commenting, ""The decline of Ronaldinho hasn't surprised me. His physical condition has always been very precarious. His talent though has never been in question.""[55]","Ronaldinho's second season did not begin on a high note, although he started nearly every match before finding himself on the bench again. After a while, Ronaldinho rediscovered his form and was arguably Milan's best player of the season. He changed his role from an attacking midfielder to a left winger, a more familiar role.","On 10 January 2010, Ronaldinho scored two goals against Juventus in an away match, sealing a 3–0 victory for the Rossoneri. In the following match, against Siena on 17 January 2010, Ronaldinho scored his first hat-trick for Milan when he converted a penalty kick, scored with a header from a corner and finished with a wonder goal from 20 yards out.[66] On 16 February, Ronaldinho played his first match against Manchester United in a Champions League game at the San Siro.[67] He scored early in the game to give Milan the lead. Milan ended up losing the game 3–2, with a goal from Paul Scholes and two goals from Wayne Rooney.[67]","Ronaldinho finished the season as the assists leader of Serie A. On a less positive note, however, he missed three penalties in the domestic season to add to one botched kick the previous season. Ronaldinho ended the Serie A campaign scoring two goals against Juventus; Luca Antonini opened the scoring and Milan went on to win 3–0 in manager Leonardo's last game in charge.[68]","After being heavily linked with a move back to his childhood club Grêmio, Ronaldinho joined Flamengo on 11 January 2011 with a contract ending in 2014.[69] During the transfer saga, many reports had linked the former World Player of the Year to joining different clubs, such as LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer, Blackburn Rovers of the Premier League, and Brazilian clubs Corinthians and Palmeiras. He was greeted by more than 20,000 fans at his unveiling at his new club on 13 January 2011.[70]","Ronaldinho scored his first goal for Flamengo in the 3–2 victory against Boavista on 6 February 2011.[71] On 27 February, he converted a second-half free kick for Flamengo to beat Boavista 1–0 and win his first piece of silverware with the team, the Taça Guanabara. Ronaldinho lifted his first trophy with Flamengo after curling in a right-footed shot over the wall in the 71st minute at Engenhão stadium. The goal gave Flamengo its 19th Taça Guanabara title, which earned the Campeonato Carioca title two months later, as the team also won the Taça Rio. On 27 July 2011, Ronaldinho scored a hat-trick in Flamengo's 5–4 away win against rivals Santos, after being 3–0 down inside the first 30 minutes.[72] On 31 May 2012, after being absent for a few days, he sued Flamengo claiming lack of payment for four months and cancelled his contract with the club.[73]","Ronaldinho made a move to Atlético Mineiro on 4 June 2012 in a six-month contract, just four days after leaving Flamengo. He wore number 49 in reference to his mother's birth year since his preferred number 10 was already assigned to Guilherme in the 2012 season.[74]","Ronaldinho made his debut for Galo on 9 June 2012, playing for 90 minutes in a 1–0 away win against Palmeiras,[75] and scored his first goal for the club on 23 June 2012 against Náutico, from the penalty spot.[76] Ronaldinho led Atlético Mineiro to a good 2012 season, in which the club finished second in the 2012 Brasileirão and qualified for the 2013 Copa Libertadores. Ronaldinho won the Bola de Ouro award, selected as the best player in the league.[77]","The following year, Ronaldinho helped Atlético win the Campeonato Mineiro and led the club to its first title of the Copa Libertadores. Ronaldinho scored four goals and assisted on seven occasions during Atlético's dramatic title run, which included consecutive comebacks from 0–2 first leg defeats in both the semi-finals against Argentinian Newell's Old Boys and the finals against Club Olimpia from Paraguay. Both ties were determined in Atlético's favour after penalty shootouts. Ronaldinho's displays saw him voted the 2013 South American Footballer of the Year.[78] He renewed his contract with Atlético in 2014,[79] and after winning the 2014 Recopa Sudamericana, Ronaldinho left the club in July, reaching an agreement to cancel his contract by mutual consent.[80]","After becoming a free agent, Ronaldinho was offered contracts from English Conference South club Basingstoke Town and newly formed Indian Super League franchise Chennai Titans through their co-owner Prashant Agarwal,[81][82][83] but eventually signed a two-year contract with Mexican club Querétaro on 5 September 2014.[84][85] Ronaldinho made his debut for Querétaro in a 1–0 loss to Tigres UANL where he missed a penalty kick.[86] In his next match, however, against Guadalajara, he had a much better game, setting up Camilo Sanvezzo to score as well as scoring himself from a penalty kick in a 4–1 win.[87] On 30 October 2014, he scored a free kick against Atlas during an away match at the Estadio Jalisco.[88]","On 18 April 2015, Ronaldinho scored twice against Liga MX title-holders América in an away game at the Estadio Azteca, in which his team won 4–0.[89] All of the spectators, mostly consisting of América supporters, gave a standing ovation to Ronaldinho after his goals had brought him to tears. This was the second time in Ronaldinho's career he had received such an ovation from opposing fans (after Madrid fans had applauded his performance in a Barcelona shirt in 2005), and after the match, Ronaldinho stated in an interview, ""It is an emotion to live more. I had an ovation at the Bernabéu and now here. I never imagined this. It is something that makes me like Mexico even more and I feel right at home.""[90][91]","Ronaldinho scored two penalties in consecutive matches, the second giving Querétaro the classification to the Liga MX playoffs.[92] On 17 May 2015, Querétaro progressed to the semi-finals after defeating Veracruz 4–3 aggregate. In the second match, Ronaldinho scored a free kick with the help of the opponent's goalkeeper who made contact with the ball.[93] In June 2015, Ronaldinho, now 35, announced his departure from the club and thanked the Mexican people and fans of Querétaro: “I want to thank all the Mexican nation for all the days that I have lived with people so special, you will be forever in my heart. Thank you very much the Nation Gallos Blancos, which made me very proud to wear this shirt and defend this club.""[94]","On 11 July 2015, Ronaldinho announced his return to Brazil and signed an 18-month contract with Fluminense,[95] but on 28 September, Ronaldinho reached a mutual agreement with the club to terminate the deal.[96] He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club, failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans.[97] Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated, ""Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting. He respectfully told us he didn't feel he was able to perform as good as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him. He made a great gesture in saying he wasn't being the player he felt he could be right now. I'll never speak about whether or not he is retiring. That's not something you say about a player of his calibre. He was always spectacular, as player and person.""[97]","Ronaldinho is one of few Brazilian players to have played at every international age level. In 1997, he was part of the first Brazilian team to win the FIFA U-17 World Championship, which was held in Egypt, in which his first goal was a penalty against Austria in the first group match, which Brazil won 7–0.[98] Ronaldinho finished with two goals and was awarded the Bronze Ball award as Brazil scored a total of 21 goals while only conceding 2.[98]","1999 was a busy year for Ronaldinho in terms of international play. First he appeared in the South American Youth Championship, where he scored three goals and helped the U20s to reach third place.[99] Then he took part in that year's FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria, scoring his first goal in Brazil's last group match.[100] In the round of 16, he scored two first-half goals in a 4–0 win over Croatia, and finished with three goals as Brazil were eliminated by Uruguay in the quarter-finals.[100]","On 26 June, three days before the start of the 1999 Copa América, he earned his first cap for Brazil in a 3–0 win over Latvia, and he scored one goal during Brazil's victorious Copa América campaign. One week after the conclusion of the Copa América, he was called up for the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which he scored in every match except the final, including a hat-trick in an 8–2 semi-final rout of Saudi Arabia.[101] In the final, Brazil lost 4–3 to Mexico. Ronaldinho won the Golden Ball award for the best player in tournament as well as the Golden Boot award for the tournament top-scorer.[101]","In 2000, Ronaldinho participated in the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, with the U23 team. Earlier that year, Ronaldinho led Brazil to win the Pre-Olympic Tournament, scoring nine goals in seven matches. In the Olympics, however, Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Cameroon, who later won the gold medal.[102] Ronaldinho appeared four times and scored only one goal, which came in the quarter-final defeat by Cameroon.[102]","Ronaldinho participated in his first World Cup in 2002, as part of a formidable offensive unit with Ronaldo and Rivaldo, dubbed the ""Three Rs"", who were also on the 1999 Copa América winning squad.[103] The World Cup was held in Korea and Japan, and Ronaldinho appeared in five matches during the tournament and scored two goals, as well as contributing several important assists. His first goal came in the group stage match against China PR, which Brazil won 4–0.[104]","The most memorable match in Ronaldinho's World Cup career took place in the quarter-final against England on 21 June.[105] With Brazil trailing after Michael Owen's 23-minute strike, Ronaldinho turned the game around. Having received the ball inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran at the England defence and wrong footed star defender Ashley Cole with a trademark step over before passing the ball to Rivaldo on the edge of the penalty area to score the equalising goal just before half-time.[106] Then, in the 50th minute, Ronaldinho took a free-kick from 40 yards out which curled into the top left corner of the net, completely surprising England's goalkeeper David Seaman, giving Brazil a 2–1 lead.[105] Seven minutes later, however, he was controversially sent-off for a foul on England's defender Danny Mills. Ronaldinho was suspended for the semi-final, but returned to Brazil's starting lineup for the 2–0 victory over Germany in the final as Brazil won its record fifth World Cup title.[107]","Ronaldinho's next international tournament was the 2003 Confederations Cup, in which he went scoreless as Brazil were eliminated in the group stage. The following year, he was dropped from Brazil's 2004 Copa América squad, as coach Carlos Alberto Parreira decided to rest his stars and used a largely reserve squad.[108]","After falling short in 1999 and 2003, Ronaldinho was the captain of Brazil and led his team to its second ever Confederations Cup title in 2005. He converted a penalty kick in a 3–2 semi-final win against host Germany and was named Man of the Match in a 4–1 victory over archrival Argentina in the final on 29 June.[109] Ronaldinho scored three goals in the tournament and is currently tied with Mexican forward Cuauhtémoc Blanco as the tournament's all-time scorer with nine goals.[110]","For the 2006 World Cup finals, Ronaldinho was part of Brazil's much-publicized ""magic quartet"" of offensive players alongside Adriano, Ronaldo and Kaká, which was expected to provide the ""Joga Bonito"" style of play that was the focus of an extensive advertising campaign by Nike leading up to the tournament. However, the group finished with only six goals in five games, with Ronaldinho himself going scoreless and finishing with only one assist (for Gilberto's goal in a 4–1 group stage victory over Japan), as he turned in his worst collective performance in his international career. Brazil endured a disappointing campaign that culminated in a 1–0 loss to France in the quarter-finals, during which the Seleção had only one shot on goal for the entire match.[111]","The team was harshly criticized by Brazilian fans and media following their return home. On 3 July, two days after Brazil's elimination, vandals immolated and destroyed a 7.5-metre (23-foot) tall fiberglass and resin statue of Ronaldinho in Chapecó.[112] The statue had been erected in 2004 to celebrate his first FIFA World Player of the Year award. That same day, Ronaldinho, joined by Adriano, returned to the city of Barcelona and held a party at his home, which was continued into the early morning hours at a nightclub. This aggravated the hard feelings of many Brazilian fans, who believed that they were betrayed by the lack of effort from the squad.[113]","On 24 March 2007, Ronaldinho scored twice in a 4–0 win over Chile, which marked his first goal since the 2005 Confederations Cup final and thus ended a scoreless streak that lasted nearly two years.[114] He was not called up for the 2007 Copa América after asking to be excused from the tournament due to fatigue.[115] On 18 October, he was controversially benched by Barcelona after he was late returning to Spain following Brazil's 5–0 friendly win over Ecuador. He and several Brazil players celebrated the win by partying through the night at a posh Rio de Janeiro nightclub. Ronaldinho left at 11 am the next morning, allegedly in the trunk of a car in order to avoid the media.[116]","On 7 July 2008, Ronaldinho was named in Brazil's 2008 Summer Olympics squad as one of the over-age players.[117] Barcelona initially blocked the move because of his then-upcoming Champions League commitments with the club, but the decision was later nullified following Ronaldinho's transfer to Milan, who in turn permitted him to make the trip to Beijing, China.[118] Ronaldinho captained the team, and he scored his only two goals in a 5–0 victory over New Zealand before Brazil were beaten by Argentina in the semi-final. Brazil finished with the bronze medal after defeating Belgium 3–0 in the bronze medal match.[119]","Despite having returned to good form and being named as a member of the 30-man provisional squad that was submitted to FIFA on 11 May 2010,[120] he was not named in coach Dunga's final squad of 23 for the Brazilian squad in South Africa for the 2010 World Cup[121] despite his deep desire to participate in the competition.[122] Critics claimed that the exclusion of players such as Ronaldinho, Alexandre Pato, Adriano and Ronaldo signaled a move away from the classic Brazilian attacking ""Jogo Bonito"" style of play.[123] At the tournament, Brazil was eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarter-final.[124]","In September 2011, Ronaldinho made his return to the national team under coach Mano Menezes in a friendly against Ghana at Fulham's Craven Cottage,[125] playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 win for Brazil. He then had solid performances in back to back friendlies against Argentina in the same month. In October, he performed well against Mexico in a friendly, scoring a free kick to equalize after Dani Alves was sent off. Brazil went on to win the match with a goal from Marcelo.[126]","Ronaldinho's good form continued in 2013, and in January he was unexpectedly called up by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari[127] for a friendly against England played on 6 February at Wembley Stadium as part of the The Football Association (FA)'s 150th anniversary.[128] Ronaldinho started in what was his 100th cap (including non-official matches), and had a chance to score from the penalty kick, but his shot was saved by Joe Hart. Brazil lost the match 1–2.[129] He was again called up for the Seleção, being named captain of the national team for an international friendly with Chile on 24 April 2013.[130] However, Ronaldinho was not selected for the national team for the 2013 Confederations Cup and he was also omitted from Scolari's 2014 World Cup finals squad.[131]","Ronaldinho is regarded as one of the greatest and most skilful players of his generation.[132][133] Due to his ability to score and create goals, he is capable of playing in several offensive positions, on either wing or in a central position.[134][135] Throughout his career, he has been deployed as a forward, a winger, although he usually plays as a classic number 10 in an attacking midfield role.[135][136] Despite primarily being a creative player, he is an accurate finisher with either foot, both from inside and outside the penalty area, and is also a free-kick and penalty kick specialist.[135][137] Throughout his career, Ronaldinho has been praised in particular for his technical skills and creativity; due to his pace, acceleration, agility, balance, ball control, and dribbling ability, he is capable of beating players when undertaking individual runs, often using feints in one on one situations.[135][138][139] Among his repertoire of moves, Ronaldinho is one of the best exponents of the ""Elastico"", a move he learned by watching videos of one of his idols, the 1970s Brazilian star Rivelino.[140][141]","ESPN has described Ronaldinho as being ""skillful by nature, his tricks are unparalleled and he is wonderful with the ball at his feet. One of the coolest players in pressure situations"" and a ""fast, brash, skilful, tricky, an uninhibited playmaker"" who provides ""a mix of goals, assists, skills and a large repertoire of crafty moves"".[142] Former Portugal midfield playmaker Rui Costa has said of his vision and passing ability: ""There are not many players who can offer goalscoring passes like he can. He is just marvellous. He is a rare case of an assist man who can provide the ball from anywhere.""[142]","Ronaldinho has had endorsements with many companies, including Nike, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, EA Sports, Gatorade and Danone.[43][143] One of the world's highest paid players, in 2006 he earned over $19 million from endorsements.[144] Having endorsed Pepsi for much of his career and appeared in commercials with David Beckham, Thierry Henry and Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho signed a deal with Coca-Cola in 2011, however this was terminated in July 2012 after he was caught drinking Pepsi in a news conference.[145]","Ronaldinho has featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series, appearing on the cover of FIFA Football 2004, FIFA 06, FIFA 07, FIFA 08 and FIFA 09.[143] At the beginning of his career Ronaldinho signed a lucrative 10-year deal with sportswear company Nike (wearing Nike Tiempo R10 boots designed for him).[43] He has appeared in Nike commercials, including the 2002 ""Secret Tournament"" commercial (branded ""Scopion KO"") directed by Terry Gilliam.[146] His 2005 Nike advertisement, where he is given a new pair of boots and then proceeds to juggle a football and appears to repeatedly volley it against the crossbar of a goal and recover it without the ball touching the ground, went viral on YouTube, becoming the site's first video to reach one million views.[147]","A wax sculpture of Ronaldinho was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong in December 2007.[148] Ronaldinho has had an official role with UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, since February 2006.[149] In 2011, he was recruited by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS to promote awareness among young people of the disease and how to avoid it.[150] In March 2015, Ronaldinho was the sixth most popular sportsperson on Facebook, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Beckham, Neymar and Kaká, with 31 million Facebook fans.[151][152]","In 2012, two Brazilian entomologists named a new species of bee, from Brazil, Eulaema quadragintanovem, stating that ""the specific epithet honors the Brazilian soccer player Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, famous worldwide as 'Ronaldinho' and in Brazil as ‘Ronaldinho Gaúcho’.

He is one of four players to have won the UEFA Champions League two years in a row with different teams, the others being Marcel Desailly, Paulo Sousa and Samuel Eto'o.[3]","Piqué has also represented Spain, making his debut on 11 February 2009. He played an integral role in the Spain team that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012.",,,"Born in Barcelona, Catalonia,[2] Piqué started his career in FC Barcelona's youth teams as a defensive midfielder, but before he signed his first professional contract with the club, he decided to join Manchester United. The Premier League side did not pay a fee for Piqué as he was too young to have a professional contract.","Piqué made his debut for Manchester United in October 2004, as a late replacement for John O'Shea in a 3–0 League Cup victory at Crewe Alexandra as a centre back.[4] He made his full debut on 29 March 2006 against West Ham United, in a Premier League match at Old Trafford, playing at right back, as Gary Neville was unavailable through injury.[5]","His performances, most notably in the reserve team, earned him a new contract, which he signed in February 2005 to run until the summer of 2009. On 4 August 2006, however, La Liga side Real Zaragoza secured Piqué on a season-long loan. The conditions of the loan involved Piqué having to feature in at least 20 games for the Aragonese club,[6] which he did, as he made 22 first team appearances in a successful spell, alongside Argentine Gabriel Milito, either as a centre back or a defensive midfielder.","On 5 May 2007, it was announced that Piqué would be staying at Old Trafford for the following season. Sir Alex Ferguson had intended to assess Piqué's form at La Romareda on 6 May, prior to a meeting where the two parties would discuss Piqué's future prospects with the club. However, Ferguson was unable to attend on account of airline difficulties.[7]","Piqué's return to Old Trafford saw him make nine league appearances during the 2007–08 season. He scored on his first start in the UEFA Champions League, a 4–0 home win against Dynamo Kyiv on 7 November 2007, as Piqué scored the first of Manchester United's four goals in that match.[8] In doing so, he became the 450th player to score at least one goal for the club.[9] His second goal for the club also came in the Champions League, in an away match to Roma on 12 December 2007.[10]","On 27 May 2008, Piqué signed a four-year contract with Barcelona, with a €5 million buy-out clause.[11] Barcelona paid a £5 million fee for the player.[12] He expressed his joy at re-signing with his boyhood club, although he admitted he had enjoyed his spell at Manchester United:","""I am very happy to be back, I didn't think I would be here again but this is very good for me.

The match finished 3–0 to Brazil, ending Spain's world record 29 match unbeaten run in competitive internationals.[40]","Piqué became unpopular with some elements of the Spanish support, due to his taunting of Barcelona's rivals Real Madrid. A friendly against England in November 2015 was moved from Real's Bernabeu Stadium to Alicante in order to avoid crowd abuse towards him.[41]","At the UEFA Euro 2016 opening group game for Spain, Piqué scored his fifth goal for his country, a late header in a 1–0 victory against the Czech Republic.[42]","Piqué is a modern defender, who combines strength with good technique and passing. Due to his height and physical attributes, he is good in the air. Although he is primarily deployed as a centre back, he is a tactically versatile player who is capable of playing as a defensive midfielder; he has also been deployed as a sweeper on occasion, showing similarities to German legend, Franz Beckenbauer, thus earning the sobriquet ""Piquénbauer"".[43] He has also occasionally been known to utilise his height as an additional attacking threat by advancing into more offensive positions.[44][45]","Piqué was raised in a Catalan family.

Wayne_Rooney,"Wayne Mark Rooney (/ˈruːni/; born 24 October 1985) is an English professional footballer who plays for and captains both Manchester United and the England national team.

He is the record goalscorer for the England national team and for Manchester United.","Aged nine, Rooney joined the youth team of Everton, for whom he made his professional debut in 2002 at the age of 16. He spent two seasons at the Merseyside club, before moving to Manchester United for £25.6 million in the 2004 summer transfer window. Since then, with Rooney in the team, United have won the Premier League five times, the UEFA Champions League once, the FIFA Club World Cup once, the FA Community Shield four times, the Football League Cup thrice and the FA Cup once. In September 2013, Rooney scored his 200th goal for Manchester United.[3] He is currently on 250 goals in all competitions which makes him the club's top goalscorer of all time.

Rooney holds the record for most goals for one club in the Premier League, with 180 for Manchester United.","Rooney made his senior international debut in February 2003 aged 17, becoming the youngest player to represent England (a record since broken by Theo Walcott) and he is England's youngest ever goalscorer.[4] He played at UEFA Euro 2004 and scored four goals, briefly becoming the youngest goalscorer in the history of the European Championship. Rooney has since featured at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 World Cups and is widely regarded as his country's best player.[5][6][7][8] He has won the England Player of the Year award four times, in 2008, 2009, 2014 and 2015.

Rooney has won the Goal of the Season award by the BBC's Match of the Day poll on three occasions, with his bicycle kick against rivals Manchester City winning the Premier League Goal of the 20 Seasons award.[9]",,,"Rooney was born in Croxteth, Liverpool, to Jeanette Marie (née Morrey) and Thomas Wayne Rooney.[10] He is of Irish descent[11][12] and was brought up as a Roman Catholic[13][14] with younger brothers Graham and John;[15] all three attended Our Lady and St Swithin's primary school[16] and De La Salle School.[17] He grew up supporting Everton.[18]","Rooney began playing for Liverpool Schoolboys and scored 72 goals in one season, a record which stood until May 2010.[19] At age nine, Rooney played for Copplehouse boys' club in the local Walton and Kirkdale junior league and scored 99 goals in his final season before being spotted by Everton scout Bob Pendleton.[20] Rooney joined Everton at age nine,[21] and was the Everton mascot for the Merseyside derby against Liverpool as an 11-year-old.[22] In the 1995–96 season, he scored 114 goals in 29 games for Everton's under-10s and 11s,[23] and by the age of 15, he was playing for the under-19s.[24] He scored eight goals in eight games during Everton's run to the FA Youth Cup final in 2002.[25] This included one goal in the final defeat against Aston Villa and, upon scoring, he revealed a T-shirt that read, ""Once a Blue, always a Blue.""[21] Rooney was included in Everton's first team squad for their training camp in Austria in the summer of 2002 and scored his first senior goal in a 3–1 friendly victory over SC Weiz on 15 July.[24]","""Rooney is the biggest England talent I've seen since I arrived in England. There has certainly not been a player under 20 as good as him since I became a manager here.""","Rooney was an unused substitute in Everton's 1–0 away win over Southampton on 20 April 2002.[27] He made his senior debut on 17 August in a 2–2 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur, starting the match and assisting the first goal by Mark Pembridge.[28] He became the second youngest first-team player in Everton history behind Joe Royle.[29] In that match, he was booed by the Spurs fans who shouted ""Who are ya?"" whenever he touched the ball.[30] His first senior goals came on 2 October when he scored twice in a 3–0 away win over Wrexham in the second round of the League Cup.[31] These goals meant that Rooney was Everton's youngest-ever goalscorer at the time.[32]","On 19 October, five days before his 17th birthday, Rooney scored a last-minute winning goal against Arsenal.[33] The goal ended Arsenal's 30-match unbeaten run,[34] and also made Rooney the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history, a record that has since been surpassed twice, by James Milner and James Vaughan.[35] He scored the only goal in a 1–0 away win over Leeds United 15 days later.[36]","In December, Rooney was named 2002's BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year.[37] Six days after claiming the award he scored the winning goal against Blackburn Rovers in a 2–1 home win.[38] His first career red card came on Boxing Day in a 1–1 away draw against Birmingham City for a late challenge on Steve Vickers.[39] In January 2003, Rooney signed his first professional contract, which made him one of world football's highest-paid teenagers.[40] Rooney's first goal of 2003 came on 23 March, netting Everton's only goal in a 2–1 loss at Arsenal.[41] In April, he scored a goal in Everton's 2–1 home win over Newcastle United,[42] before hitting a last-minute winner against Aston Villa in another 2–1 home win.[43] He ended his debut season with 8 goals in 37 appearances in all competitions for the Toffees.[44]","Rooney scored his first goal of the 2003–04 season in a 2–2 away draw against Charlton Athletic on 26 August 2003.[45] He did not find the net again until December when he scored in a 2–1 away win over Portsmouth,[46] and a 3–2 home win over Leicester City.[47] His final goal of 2003 came on his 50th league appearance, netting the only goal in a 1–0 home win over Birmingham City on 28 December.[48] On 21 February 2004, Rooney scored two goals in a Premier League game for the first time in a 3–3 away draw against Southampton.[49] He scored the sole goal in a 1–0 win over Portsmouth on 13 March,[50] before scoring in a 1–1 away draw against Leicester City one week later.[51] He scored his final goal of the season in a 1–1 away draw against Leeds United on 13 April.[52]","Rooney made a transfer request in August 2004, despite Everton having made a new contract offer valued at £50,000 per week.[53] Everton then rejected a bid of £20 million from Newcastle,[54] and ultimately signed for Manchester United at the end of the month after a £25.6 million deal was reached.[55] It was the highest fee ever paid for a player under 20 years old; Rooney was still only 18 when he left Everton.[56] Sir Alex Ferguson, then manager of United, said that ""There were plenty of eyebrows raised"" when he persuaded the club's board of directors to sanction ""a multi-million pound"" move to try to sign Rooney from Everton.[57]","Rooney was given the number 8 shirt upon his arrival at Old Trafford.[58] He made his United debut on 28 September in a 6–2 home win over Fenerbahçe in the UEFA Champions League, scoring a hat-trick and laying on an assist.[59] These goals made Rooney the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League aged 18 years 335 days.[60] His first season with Manchester United, however, ended without winning a trophy as they could only manage a third-place finish in the league,[61] and failed to progress to the last eight of the Champions League.[62] United had more success in the cup competitions, but were edged out of the League Cup in the semi-finals by a Chelsea side[63] who also won the Premier League title that season,[64] and a goalless draw with Arsenal in the FA Cup final was followed by a penalty shoot-out defeat.[65] Rooney was United's top league scorer that season with 11 goals, and was credited with the PFA Young Player of the Year award.[66]","In September 2005, Rooney was sent off in a goalless Champions League match against Villarreal of Spain for sarcastically clapping the referee, who had booked him for an unintentional foul on an opponent.[67] His first trophy with United came in the 2005–06 League Cup,[68] and he was also named man of the match after scoring twice in the final as United won 4–0 against Wigan Athletic.[69] His club finished the season as Premier League runners up, with their title hopes ended in late April when they lost 3–0 away to champions Chelsea.[70] Rooney sustained a broken metatarsal in that game after a tackle from Paulo Ferreira.

Rooney scored a goal from the penalty spot to level the game after Andrey Arshavin had put the Gunners ahead. The game finished 2–1 to Manchester United after Abou Diaby scored an own goal.[102] On 28 November 2009, Rooney scored his first hat-trick for three years in a 4–1 away victory against Portsmouth, with two of the goals being penalties.[103] On 27 December 2009, he was awarded Man of the Match against Hull City. He was involved in all the goals scored in the game, hitting the opener and then giving away the ball for Hull's equalising penalty. He then forced Andy Dawson into conceding an own goal and then set up Dimitar Berbatov for United's third goal which gave them a 3–1 victory.[104] On 30 December 2009, Rooney scored another goal as United beat Wigan 5–0 in their final game of the decade.[105]","On 23 January 2010, Rooney scored all four goals in Manchester United's 4–0 win over Hull; three of the goals came in the last ten minutes of the match.

Bayern won the match after netting a second away-goal[115] and Rooney was substituted after re-damaging his ankle.

Fox News also created the ""Fox News Alert,"" which interrupted its regular programming when a breaking news story occurred.","To accelerate its adoption by cable providers, Fox News paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel.[30] This contrasted with the normal practice, in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming. When Time Warner bought Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System, a federal antitrust consent decree required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own CNN on its cable systems. Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel, not Fox News. Fox News claimed that this violated an agreement (to carry Fox News). Citing its agreement to keep its U.S. headquarters and a large studio in New York City, News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration to pressure Time Warner Cable (one of the city's two cable providers) to transmit Fox News on a city-owned channel.[31] City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner's cable franchises in the city.[32]","During the September 11, 2001 attacks, Fox News was the first news organization to run a news ticker on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day. The ticker has remained, informing viewers about additional news which reporters may not mention on-screen and repeating news mentioned during a broadcast; it has proven popular with viewers.[33]","FNC maintains an archive of most of its programs. This archive also includes Fox Movietone newsreels. Licensing for the Fox News archive is handled by ITN Source, the archiving division of ITN.[34]","FNC presents a variety of programming, with up to 15 hours of live broadcasting per day in addition to programming and content for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Most programs are broadcast from Fox News headquarters in New York City (at 1211 Avenue of the Americas), in its streetside studio on Sixth Avenue in the west wing of Rockefeller Center, sharing its headquarters with sister channel Fox Business Network. Fox News Channel has eight studios at its New York City headquarters that are used for its and Fox Business' programming: Studio B (used for Fox Business programming), Studio D (which has an area for studio audiences; and is used by Outnumbered), Studio E (used for Fox & Friends, Happening Now, Your World with Neil Cavuto, and certain editions of America's News HQ), Studio F (used for The Story With Martha Maccallum, The Five, and America's Election Headquarters) Studio G (which houses Fox Business shows), Studio H (Fox News Deck used for Shepard Smith Reporting and breaking news coverage), Studio J (used for Fox & Friends First, America's Newsroom, Hannity and Justice with Judge Jeanine) and the Web Studio (used for Fox News Live internet shows).","The remaining programs (such as Special Report with Bret Baier, On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren, and editions of America's News HQ not broadcast from the New York City studios) are broadcast from Fox News's Washington, D.C. studio, located on Capitol Hill across from Union Station in a secured building shared by a number of other television networks (including NBC News and C-SPAN). Audio simulcasts of the channel are aired on XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio.","In an October 11, 2009 New York Times article, Fox articulated that its hard-news programming runs from ""9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. on weekdays"" and ""[is] objective""; however, it makes no such claims for its other broadcasts, which primarily consist of editorial journalism and commentary.[35]","Fox News Channel began broadcasting in the 720p resolution format on May 1, 2008.[36] This format is available on all major cable and satellite providers.","With the growth of FNC, the company introduced a radio division, Fox News Radio, in 2003.[37] Syndicated throughout the United States, the division provides short newscasts and talk radio programs featuring personalities from the television and radio divisions. In 2006, the company also introduced Fox News Talk, a satellite radio station featuring programs syndicated by (and featuring) Fox News personalities.","Introduced in December 1995,[38] the Fox News website features the latest coverage (including columns by FNC television, radio and online personalities). Video clips are also available on Foxnews.com and Foxbusiness.com. Fox News Latino is the version aimed at the Hispanic audience, although presented almost entirely in English, with a Spanish section.[39]","In September 2008, FNC joined other channels in introducing a live streaming segment to its website: The Strategy Room, designed to appeal to older viewers. It airs weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and takes the form of an informal discussion, with running commentary on the news. Regular discussion programs include Business Hour, News With a View and God Talk.[40] In March 2009, The Fox Nation was launched as a website intended to encourage readers to post, commenting on the news.[41] Fox News Mobile is the portion of the FNC website dedicated to streaming news clips formatted for video-enabled mobile phones.[42]","FNC saw a large ratings jump during the early stages of the US invasion of Iraq. According to some reports, at the height of the conflict Fox News had as much as a 300-percent increase in viewership (averaging 3.3 million viewers daily).[46] In 2004, FNC's ratings for its broadcast of the Republican National Convention exceeded those of the three major broadcast networks. During President George W. Bush's address, Fox News attracted 7.3 million viewers nationally; NBC, ABC, and CBS had a viewership of 5.9 million, 5.1 million and 5.0 million respectively.","In late 2005 and early 2006, FNC saw a brief decline in ratings. One decline was in the second quarter of 2006, when Fox News lost viewers for every prime-time program compared with the previous quarter. The audience for Special Report with Brit Hume, for example, dropped 19 percent. Several weeks later, in the wake of the 2006 North Korean missile test and the 2006 Lebanon War, Fox saw a surge in viewership and remained the #1-rated cable news channel.[47][48] Fox produced eight of the top ten most-watched nightly cable news shows, with The O'Reilly Factor and Hannity & Colmes finishing first and second respectively.[49]","FNC ranked #8 in viewership among all cable channels in 2006, and #6 in 2007.[50] The channel ranked #1 during the week of Barack Obama's election (November 3–9) in 2008, and reached the top spot again in January 2010 (during the week of the special Senate election in Massachusetts).[51] Comparing Fox to its 24-hour-news-channel competitors, in May 2010 the channel drew an average daily prime-time audience of 1.8 million viewers (versus 747,000 for MSNBC and 595,000 for CNN).[52]","In September 2009, the Pew Research Center published a report on the public view of national news organizations. In the report, 72 percent of polled Republican Fox viewers rated the channel as ""favorable"", while 43 percent of polled Democratic viewers and 55 percent of all polled viewers shared that opinion. However, Fox was given the highest ""unfavorable"" rating of all national outlets studied (25 percent of all polled viewers). The report went on to say, ""partisan differences in views of Fox News have increased substantially since 2007"".[53]","On the night of October 22, 2012, Fox set a record for its highest-rated telecast ever, with 11.5 million viewers for the third U.S. presidential debate.[54][55] In prime time the week before, Fox averaged almost 3.7 million viewers with a total day average of 1.66 million viewers.[56]","A Public Policy Polling poll concluded in 2013 that perceptions of FNC had declined from 2010. 41% of polled voters said they trust it, down from 49% in 2010, while 46% said they distrust it, up from 37% in 2010. It was also called the ""most trusted"" network by 34% of those polled, more than had said the same of any other network.[57]","In primetime and total day ratings for the week of April 15 to 21, 2013, Fox News, propelled by its coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing, was the highest-ranked network on U.S. cable television, for the first time since August 2005, when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States.[58]","January 2014 marked Fox News's 145th consecutive month as the number one rated cable news channel. During that month, Fox News beat CNN and MSNBC combined in overall viewers in both prime time hours and the total day.[59] In the third quarter of 2014, the network was the most-watched cable channel during prime time hours.[60]","During the final week of the campaign for the United States elections, 2014, Fox News had the highest ratings of any cable channel, news or otherwise. On election night itself, Fox News' coverage had higher ratings than that of any of the other five cable or network news sources among viewers between 25 and 54 years of age.[61]","The network hosted the first prime-time GOP candidates' forum of the 2016 campaign on August 6. The debate reached a record-breaking 24 million viewers, by far the largest audience ever for any cable news event.[62]","As indicated by a New York Times article, based on Nielsen statistics, Fox appears to have a mostly aged demographic.[63] In 2008, in the 25–54 age group, Fox News had an average of 557,000 viewers, but dropped to 379,000 in 2013 while increasing its overall audience from 1.89 million in 2010 to 2.02 million in 2013. The median age of a prime-time viewer was 68 as of 2015.[64]","""Fair & Balanced"" is a trademarked slogan used by the broadcaster, originally used in conjunction with the phrase ""Real Journalism"". Comedian Al Franken used the slogan in the subtitle for his 2003 book Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right. In the book, he cites examples of what he claims to be Fox News' bias. On August 7, 2003, Fox News sued for trademark infringement.[65] The lawsuit was dropped three days later, after Judge Denny Chin refused its request for an injunction. In his decision, Chin ruled that the case (Fox v. Franken) was ""wholly without merit, both factually and legally"". He went on to suggest that Fox News' trademark on the phrase ""fair and balanced"" could be invalid.[66]","In December 2003, FNC won a legal battle concerning the slogan, when AlterNet filed a cancellation petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to have FNC's trademark rescinded as inaccurate. AlterNet included the documentary film Outfoxed as supporting evidence in its case.[67] After losing early motions, AlterNet withdrew its petition; the USPTO dismissed the case.[68] In 2008, FNC used the slogan ""We Report, You Decide"", referring to ""You Decide 2008"" (FNC's original slogan for its coverage of election issues).","Fox News Channel has long been accused of promoting conservative political positions[69] and has been widely criticized for biased reporting.[7] Critics of the channel have stated Fox News has a bias favoring the political right and the Republican Party.[8] Fox News host Chris Wallace has said, ""I think we are the counter-weight [to NBC News] ... they have a liberal agenda, and we tell the other side of the story.""[70][71][72][73] Timothy Noah stated in an editorial in Slate Magazine that Fox News had a conservative bias.[74] Fox News has publicly denied such statements.[75] Murdoch and Ailes' replies have included Murdoch's statement that Fox has ""given room to both sides, whereas only one side had it before"".[76][77] In 2004, director Robert Greenwald produced the documentary film Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism, which argues that Fox News has a conservative bias.[78] The film includes clips from Fox News and internal memos from editorial vice president John Moody directing Fox News staff on how to report certain subjects.[79]","A leaked memo from Fox News vice president Bill Sammon to news staff at the height of the health care reform in the United States debate has been cited as an example of the pro-Republican Party bias of Fox News. His memo asked the staff to ""use the term 'government-run health insurance,' or, when brevity is a concern, 'government option,' whenever possible"". The memo was sent shortly after Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised Sean Hannity on his Fox show that ""If you call it a public option, the American people are split. If you call it the government option, the public is overwhelmingly against it"".[80]","A Pew Research poll released on October 29, 2009 found that Fox News is viewed as the most ideological channel in America. 47 percent of those surveyed said Fox News is ""mostly conservative"", 14 percent said ""mostly liberal"" and 24 percent said ""neither"". In comparison, MSNBC had 36 percent identify it as ""mostly liberal"", 11 percent as ""mostly conservative"" and 27 percent as ""neither"". CNN had 37 percent describe it as ""mostly liberal"", 11 percent as ""mostly conservative"" and 33 percent as ""neither"".[81] A 2004 Pew Research Center survey showed that FNC was cited (unprompted) by 69 percent of national journalists as a conservative news organization. The survey showed that 34 percent of national journalists describe themselves as liberal, compared with 7 percent who describe themselves as conservative.[82]","A poll by Rasmussen Reports found that 31 percent of Americans felt that Fox News has a conservative bias, and 15 percent that it has a liberal bias. The poll also reported that 36 percent believed Fox News delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias, compared with 37 percent who said NPR delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and 32 percent who said the same of CNN.[83] A 2007 study looked at the introduction of Fox News into local U.S. markets between 1996 and 2000, and found that in the 2000 presidential election ""Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News"". The study's estimates ""imply that Fox News convinced 3 to 28 percent of its viewers to vote Republican, depending on the audience measure"".[84]","A 2010 study by Sean Aday comparing Fox News Channel's Special Report With Brit Hume and NBC's Nightly News coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during 2005 found that both underplayed bad news; it concluded that ""Fox News was much more sympathetic to the administration than NBC"", suggesting that ""if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at FNC...they should consider Fox as alternative, rather than mainstream, media"". Aday also stated, however, that the data used in his study may have come late enough in the war to be consistent with accepted practice.[clarification needed][85]","David Carr, media critic for The New York Times, praised the 2012 presidential election results coverage on Fox News for the network's response to Republican adviser and Fox News contributor Karl Rove challenging its call that Barack Obama would win Ohio and the election. Fox's prediction was correct. Carr wrote:","Over many months, Fox lulled its conservative base with agitprop: that President Obama was a clear failure, that a majority of Americans saw [Mitt] Romney as a good alternative in hard times, and that polls showing otherwise were politically motivated and not to be believed. But on Tuesday night, the people in charge of Fox News were confronted with a stark choice after it became clear that Mr. Romney had fallen short: was Fox, first and foremost, a place for advocacy or a place for news? In this moment, at least, Fox chose news.[86]","Media Matters for America, which bills itself as a ""progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media,""[87] cataloged what it called the ten most ""egregious examples"" of ""distortion"" by both Fox News and its TV personalities.[88] Criticism includes several examples of cropping quotes from President Obama, Vice President Biden and Vice President Gore so they appear out of context, using image-manipulation software to edit the appearance of reporters from The New York Times and using footage from other events during a report on the November 5, 2009 Tea Party rally in Washington, D.C.; Media Matters said the intention of Fox News was to make it appear as if a larger number of protesters attended the event.[89] The group also called attention to the December 4, 2009 edition of Fox and Friends, accusing the program of misleading its viewers with a ""questionable graphic"" showing the result of a Rasmussen Reports climate-change poll totaling 120 percent.[90] Fox News disputed the claim that the graph was in error, saying that they merely took three pieces of polling data from Rasmussen Polls on the screen, and also pointed out that they never explicitly said on the screen that the climate change graph was supposed to equal 100%.[91]","In November 2009, Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett told viewers that a Sarah Palin book signing in Grand Rapids, Michigan had a massive turnout, showing footage of Palin with a large crowd. Jarrett stated that the former Republican vice-presidential candidate is ""continuing to draw huge crowds while she's promoting her brand-new book"", adding that the images being shown were ""some of the pictures just coming in to us.... The lines earlier had formed this morning"".[92] The video was actually taken from a 2008 McCain-Palin campaign rally. Fox senior vice president for news Michael Clemente issued a statement saying, ""This was a production error in which the copy editor changed a script and didn't alert the control room to update the video"".[92] Fox offered an on-air apology the following day during the same Happening Now segment, expressing regrets for what it described as a ""video error"" with no intent to mislead.[93]","Fox also apologized for fabricated quotes attributed to John Kerry in an article on its website during the 2004 presidential campaign,[94] stating that the piece was a joke which accidentally appeared on the website.[95]","On March 14, 2017, Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News commentator, claimed on Fox & Friends that British intelligence agency GCHQ had wiretapped Donald Trump on behalf of Barack Obama during the 2016 United States presidential election.[96][97] On March 16, 2017, White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeated the claim.[96] When Trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference, he said ""All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn't make an opinion on it.""[98] On March 17, 2017, Shepard Smith, a Fox News anchor, acknowledged that the network had no evidence that Trump was under surveillance. British officials said the White House was backing off the claim, but the White House did not release a public statement expressing regret.[98] Napolitano was later suspended by Fox News for making the claim.[99]","In September 2009, the Obama administration engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel. On September 20, President Obama appeared on all major news programs except Fox News, a snub partially in response to remarks about the president by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, and Fox coverage of Obama's health-care proposal.[100][101]","In late September 2009, Obama senior advisor David Axelrod and Roger Ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps. Two weeks later, White House officials referred to FNC as ""not a news network"", communications director Anita Dunn stating that ""Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party"".[102][103] President Obama observed, ""If media is operating basically as a talk radio format, then that's one thing, and if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another"".[104] White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel stated that it was important ""to not have the CNNs and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox"".[105]","Within days, it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official Ken Feinberg, with bureau chiefs from the White House press pool (ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN) coming to Fox's defense.[106] A bureau chief stated, ""If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues"".[107] Shortly after the story broke, the White House admitted to a low-level mistake, saying that Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg. Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett responded by stating that he had not made a specific request, but that he had a ""standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made"".[108]","On November 8, 2009, the Los Angeles Times reported that an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again. According to the article, Anita Dunn claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who ""deal with TV issues"" and had been told that nobody had been instructed to avoid Fox. Patrick Caddell, a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President Jimmy Carter, said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House.[109]","On October 2, 2013, Fox News host Anna Kooiman cited on the air a fake story from the National Report parody site, which claimed that President Obama had offered to keep the International Museum of Muslim Cultures open with cash from his own pocket.[110][111][112]","The FNC feed is available internationally via a number of providers, while Fox Extra segments provide alternate programming.[113]","Initially, U.S. advertisements were replaced on FNC with viewer e-mail and profiles of FNC anchors set to music. In 2002, these were replaced with international weather forecasts. In 2006, the weather forecasts were replaced with Fox Extra (originally Fox News Extra, prior to the international launch of Fox Business) segments, narrated reports from Fox on a variety of topics. These reports generally concern lighter issues unrelated to current news events, and the segments are repeated. FNC also shows international weather forecasts when Fox Extra segments run short. In the United Kingdom, after a period when local commercials were inserted into breaks, Fox Extra now fills most breaks.","In Australia, FNC is broadcast on the dominant pay television provider Foxtel, which is 50% owned by News Corp Australia, the Australian arm of News Corp and the sister company of 21st Century Fox which owns FNC. Local cable news channel Sky News Australia is wholly owned by News Corp Australia[114] and is therefore FNC's de facto sister channel, although has formal partnerships with FNC competitor CNN as well as both ABC News and CBS News.[115]","Since 2002, FNC has been broadcast to Brazil; however, commercials are replaced with Fox Extra. It is available in packages of Vivo TV.","In 2003, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rejected a Canadian Cable Telecommunications Association (CCTA) application to bring Fox News to Canada due to concerns that Fox News U.S. and the Global Television Network were planning to create a combined American-Canadian news network. In 2004, after a Fox News U.S. executive said there were no plans to create a combined channel, the CRTC approved an application to bring Fox News to Canada.[116]",Fox News is available on cable through French internet providers Free and Orange.,"In Indonesia, It is available in Channel 335 in pay TV provider Indovision.","FNC is carried in the Republic of Ireland by Sky, which is 40-percent owned by FNC's parent company, 21st Century Fox. It is run as a sister channel to Sky's own news channel, Sky News. FNC is usually broadcast as a VideoGuard-encrypted channel; during major news stories, it may be simulcast on Sky Active, which is free-to-air. As of September 2006, the channel has carried UK-specific advertising, headlines and weather provided by Sky News during its breaks. These run under the brand of Fox News International. Due to the shared ownership of Fox and Sky, both channels share bureaus and reporters for breaking news stories worldwide.","In Israel, FNC is broadcast on Channel 105 of the satellite provider yes. It is also broadcast on channel 71 on cable operator HOT.[117]","In Italy, FNC was launched on the now-defunct Italian digital satellite television platform Stream TV in 2001. Part of its programming was translated into Italian and broadcast on the defunct Italian news channel Stream News. In 2003, it moved to SKY Italia, with U.S. commercials replaced by Fox News Extra segments. It is available to 4.6 million subscribers and 160,000 hotel rooms. SKY TG 24 is a sister channel to Fox News.","In the Netherlands, Fox News has been carried by cable providers UPC Nederland and CASEMA, and satellite provider Canaldigitaal; all have dropped the channel in recent years. At this time, only cable provider Caiway (available in a limited number of towns in the central part of the country) is broadcasting the channel. The channel is also carried by IPTV provider KNIPPR.","In New Zealand, FNC is broadcast on Channel 088 of pay satellite operator SKY Network Television's digital platform. It was formerly broadcast overnight on free-to-air UHF New Zealand TV channel Prime (owned by SKY); this was discontinued in January 2010, reportedly due to an expiring broadcasting license.[118] Fox News' former parent company News Corporation has a stake in both SKY and Prime.","In Pakistan, Fox News Channel is available on PTCL Smart TV and a number of cable and IPTV operators.","In the Philippines, Fox News Channel was available on cable operator Destiny Cable channel 21 (analog)/channel 112 (digital) Now on SkyCable Channel 112 it is available only on digital platform. And now on Skycable available on High Definition Channel 211. It is also seen on Cignal Digital TV channel 41.","Between 2003 and 2006, in Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries, FNC was broadcast 16 hours a day on TV8 (with Fox News Extra segments replacing U.S. advertising). Fox News was dropped by TV8 and replaced by German news channel Deutsche Welle in September 2006.","In Singapore, FNC is broadcast on channel 702 on pay cable operator StarHub TV digital platform.

Funny_or_Die,"Funny or Die is a comedy video website and film/TV production company founded by Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Chris Henchy. The website Funny Or Die contains exclusive material from a regular staff of in-house writers, producers, and directors, and occasionally from a number of famous contributors like Judd Apatow, James Franco, and Norm Macdonald. The production company makes TV shows like truTV's Billy on the Street, Comedy Central's @midnight, and Zach Galifianakis's popular Emmy-winning web series Between Two Ferns.","Many videos on the site feature well-known actors (examples include Steve Carell, Charlie Sheen, Ryan Gosling, Patrick Stewart, Daniel Radcliffe, Sophia Bush, Mila Kunis, AnnaSophia Robb, Hilary Duff, Adam West, James Van Der Beek, Jim Carrey, Ariel Winter, and Selena Gomez). Michael Kvamme, an aspiring young comedian, came up with a concept for a new kind of comedy site; and the site was developed by Randy Adams.","Funny Or Die launched on April 12, 2007 with the site's first video, ""The Landlord"". ""The Landlord"" has received over 84 million views and features Ferrell confronted by a swearing, beer-drinking two-year-old landlord.[2] In June 2007, they received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital,[3] and in June 2008, they announced a partnership with HBO.[4] On August 3, 2016, Funny or Die shut-down one of its California offices, reducing its headcount by 30% to 95 employees, with the announcement coming just two month after the new CEO, Mike Farah, took office[5]",,,"Unlike other viral video sites, members of Funny Or Die are encouraged to vote on videos which they view, with the options of ""Funny"" or ""Die"". The video then gets a score of the total percent of people who voted the video ""Funny"". If the video receives an 80% or greater ""Funny"" rating after 100,000 views, it gets an ""Immortal"" ranking. If the video receives a 20% or less ""Funny"" rating after 1,000 views, it is relegated to the Crypt section of the site.","The Funny Or Die staff can also select a rating of ""Chosen One"", which disables voting for a video, merely saying ""Chosen One"" instead.[6]",Funny Or Die expanded to include a television and film production company in 2011.,"Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis is an Emmy Award-winning comedy series featured on Funny Or Die. Galifianakis interviews various celebrities on a low budget set, decorated by a pair of potted ferns. The series often involves interruptions for product promotions and musical guests. The Lonely Island’s ""Spring Break Anthem"" music video was embedded into an episode with James Franco and featured actor Edward Norton.[7]","Galifianakis has interviewed the likes of Brad Pitt, Justin Bieber, Jennifer Lawrence, Samuel L. Jackson, Richard Branson, and President Barack Obama. Galifianakis interviewed President Barack Obama during the launch of the United States health insurance exchange website www.Healthcare.gov. The video was released on March 11, 2014 and garnered over 32 million views.[8]","Funny Or Die’s Billy on the Street is a half hour comedy game show hosted by Billy Eichner. The show’s producers include Anna Wenger, Mike Farah and Billy Eichner. Billy on the Street premiered on Fuse TV on December 18, 2011. On October 8, 2015 the show began airing on tru TV. Eichner quizzes people on the streets of New York on pop culture in exchange for cash and prizes. Many episodes feature a special guest and celebrities Lindsay Lohan, Anne Hathaway, Neil Patrick Harris, and Olivia Wilde have made appearances on the show.[9]","In 2013, Eichner received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Game Show Host.[10] The series wrapped its third season on May 14, 2014.",Drunk History is a comedy series on Comedy Central that was released on Funny Or Die in December 2007. The show originated as a web series created by Derek Waters and Jeremy Konner. The show features a drunken narrator who attempts to recount an event from American history. The actors are played by celebrity guest stars who lip-sync the narrator’s dialogue.[11],"Due to their general drunkenness the narrators are unable to accurately discuss the historical events and oftentimes make up and embellish aspects of the story. Guests include Jack Black, Michael Cera, Bill Hader, Nick Offerman, Winona Ryder, Chris Parnell, Kristen Wiig, Luke Wilson, and Jason Schwartzman.","@midnight is a late night comedy panel show hosted by Chris Hardwick and produced by Funny Or Die.

Facebook,"Facebook is an American for-profit corporation and an online social media and social networking service based in Menlo Park, California. The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[6][7]","The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws.[8] The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.[9]","Facebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as ""friends"", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use various software applications (""apps""), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as ""People From Work"" or ""Close Friends"". In groups, editors can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements which appear onscreen.","Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion.

According to The Harvard Crimson, the site was comparable to Hot or Not and used ""photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person"".[14][15][16]","To accomplish this, Zuckerberg hacked into protected areas of Harvard's computer network and copied private dormitory ID images. Harvard did not have a student ""face book"" (a directory with photos and basic information) at the time, although individual houses had been issuing their own paper facebooks since the mid-1980s, and Harvard's longtime Freshman Yearbook was colloquially referred to as the ""Freshman Facebook"". Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.[14][17]","The site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating copyrights, and violating individual privacy.

He uploaded 500 Augustan images to a website, each of which was featured with a corresponding comments section.[17] He shared the site with his classmates, and people started sharing notes.","The following semester, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website in January 2004. He said that he was inspired by an editorial about the Facemash incident in The Harvard Crimson.[19] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched ""Thefacebook"", originally located at thefacebook.com.[20]","Six days after the site launched, Harvard seniors Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com.

According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5 GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom BitTorrent-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes approximately 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process is zero downtime and new changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.[207]","Facebook used a combination platform based on HBase to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, new events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them into storage. The User Interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as AJAX behavior. These requests are written to a log file using Scribe (developed by Facebook).[208]","Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out (thus the name). Ptail data is separated out into three streams so they can eventually be sent to their own clusters in different data centers (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a hash table.[208]","After this, data is output in PHP format (compiled with HipHop for PHP). The backend is written in Java and Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are used to make the web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to MapReduce servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a backup plan as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time.[208]","On March 20, 2014 Facebook announced a new open source programming language called Hack.

Users can also set which set of gender-specific pronouns are used in reference to them throughout the site.[238][239] The change occurs after Nepal's first openly gay politician Sunil Babu Pant sent a letter to Zuckerberg in early 2012 to request the addition of an ""Other"" gender option for Facebook users; Facebook's official statement on the issue: ""People can already opt out of showing their sex on their profile. We're constantly innovating on our products and features and we welcome input from everyone as we explore ways to improve the Facebook experience.""[240]","On June 13, 2009, Facebook introduced a ""Usernames"" feature, whereby pages can be linked with simpler URLs such as https://www.facebook.com/name instead of https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728.[241] Many new smartphones offer access to Facebook services through either their Web browsers or applications.

Since then, users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.[246]","On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent[247] on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user.[248] The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as Twitter.[249]","One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the Photos application, where users can upload albums and photos.[250] Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other image hosting services such as Photobucket and Flickr, which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60 photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200 photos per album.[251][252][253][254]","Privacy settings can be set for individual albums, limiting the groups of users that can see an album. For example, the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user's friends can see the album, while the privacy of another album can be set so that all Facebook users can see it. Another feature of the Photos application is the ability to ""tag"", or label, users in a photo. For instance, if a photo contains a user's friend, then the user can tag the friend in the photo. This sends a notification to the friend that she has been tagged, and provides a link to see the photo.[255]","On June 7, 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to its users. It will help the users in finding games and other applications with ease.[256] Since the launch of the App Center, Facebook has seen 150M monthly users with 2.4 times the installation of apps.[257]",The sorting and display of stories in a user's News Feed is governed by the EdgeRank algorithm.[258],"On May 13, 2015, Facebook in association with major news portals launched a program ""Instant Articles"" to provide rich news experience. Instant articles provides users, access to articles on Facebook news feed without leaving the site.[259][260]","According to the technology news web site Gizmodo on May 9, 2016, Facebook curators routinely suppress or promote news that is deemed to meet a political agenda. For example, articles about Black Lives Matter would be listed even if they did not meet the trending criteria of News Feed. Likewise positive news about conservative political figures were regularly excised from Facebook pages.[261]","In January 2017, Facebook launched Facebook Stories for iOS and Android in Ireland. The feature, following the format of Snapchat and Instagram stories, allows users to upload photos and videos that appear above friends' and followers' News Feeds and disappear after 24 hours.[262]","The like button is a social networking feature, allowing users to express their appreciation of content such as status updates, comments, photos, and advertisements. It is also a social plug-in of the Facebook Platform – launched on April 21, 2010[263][264] – that enables participating Internet websites to display a similar like button.","The sheriff of Hampton, Virginia, US, fired employees who liked the Facebook page of an adversary, and a federal appeals court in Virginia ruled that the US Constitution protects the rights of US citizens to like any Facebook page of their choosing. US Circuit Judge William Traxler likened the practice to displaying a ""political sign in one's front yard.""[265] Additionally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a National Labor Relations Board decision which found that one employee's ""liking"" another employee's negative comments about their employer deserved protection under the National Labor Relations Act, alerting employers to proceed with caution when disciplining employees for Facebook activity.[266]","Following a lengthy period of calls from the public to include a dislike button on the Facebook interface, Zuckerberg explained in a Q&A session on December 11, 2014 that his hesitance was due to a concern about a tone of negativity on the platform, whereby users could ""shame"" others, and he offered the comment option for situations where people were unwilling to use the like function. However, he said, ""We're [Facebook] thinking about it [dislike button] … It's an interesting question,"" and said that he likes the idea of Facebook users being able to express a greater variety of emotions.[106]","On September 14, 2011, Facebook added the ability for users to provide a ""Subscribe"" button on their page, which allows users to subscribe to public postings by the user without needing to add him or her as a friend.[267] In conjunction, Facebook also introduced a system in February 2012 to verify the identity of certain accounts.[268]","In December 2012, Facebook announced that because of user confusion surrounding its function, the Subscribe button would be re-labeled as a ""Follow"" button—making it more similar to other social networks with similar functions.[269]","The media often compares Facebook to Myspace, but one significant difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization.[270] Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make.[271] MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), while Facebook allows only plain text.[272] Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the Wall, a space on every user's profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see;[273] Pokes, which allows users to send a virtual ""poke"" to each other (a notification then tells a user that he or she has been poked);[274] Photos, that allows users to upload albums and photos;[275] and Status, which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions.[276] Facebook also allows users to tag various people in photographs. Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user's profile can also view that user's Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only.[273] Facebook also differs from Myspace in the form of advertising used. Facebook uses advertising in the form of banner ads, referral marketing, and games. Myspace, on the other hand, uses Google and AdSense.[277] There is also a difference in the userbase of each site. MySpace, initially, was much more popular with high school students, while Facebook was more popular among college students. A study by the American firm Nielsen Claritas showed that Facebook users are more inclined to use other professional networking sites, such as LinkedIn, than Myspace users.[277]","Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile.[279] The website is free to its users and generates revenue from advertising, such as banner ads.[280] Facebook requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings.[281]","On November 6, 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Beacon, which was a part of Facebook's advertisement system until it was discontinued in 2009.

This policy is in compliance with a United States law, the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires minors aged 13 or younger to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. In other jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age, Facebook enforces the lower age. Of the 1,007 households surveyed for the study, 76% of parents reported that their child joined Facebook at an age younger than 13, the minimum age in the site's terms of service. The study also reported that Facebook removes roughly 20,000 users each day for violating its minimum age policy. The study's authors also note, ""Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join."" The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of United States federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation, or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, and not 13.[349]","In November 2011, several Facebook users in Bangalore, India reported that their accounts had been hacked and their profile pictures replaced with pornographic images. For more than a week, users' news feeds were spammed with pornographic, violent and sexual content, and it was reported that more than 200,000 accounts were affected.

Users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the Facebook Walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to. To prove that he was telling the truth, Shreateh posted material to Sarah Goodin's wall, a friend of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Following this, Shreateh contacted Facebook's security team with the proof that his bug was real, explaining in detail what was going on. Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a US$500 fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market. However, it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee, Facebook originally told him that ""this was not a bug"" and dismissed him. Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook, but they dismissed him yet again. On the third try, Shreateh used the bug to post a message to Mark Zuckerberg's Wall, stating ""Sorry for breaking your privacy … but a couple of days ago, I found a serious Facebook exploit"" and that Facebook's security team was not taking him seriously. Within minutes, a security engineer contacted Shreateh, questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system. Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh's account and fixed the bug after several days. Facebook refused to pay out the bounty to Shreateh, stating that by posting to Zuckerberg's account, Shreateh had violated one of their terms of service policies and therefore ""could not be paid."" Facebook also noted that in Shreateh's initial reports, he had failed to provide technical details for Facebook to act on the bug.[354][355][356]","On August 22, 2013, Yahoo News reported that Marc Maiffret, a chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust, is prompting hackers to support in raising a $10,000 reward for Khalil Shreateh. On August 20, Maiffret stated that he had already raised $9,000 in his efforts, including the $2,000 he himself contributed. He and other hackers alike have denounced Facebook for refusing Shreateh compensation. Stated Maiffret, ""He is sitting there in Palestine doing this research on a five-year-old laptop that looks like it is half broken. It's something that might help him out in a big way.""

In response, Facebook stated that it will continue to use the Paper title but conceded that it should have informed FiftyThree at an earlier point in time. FiftyThree articulated its desired outcome in a blog post: ""There's a simple fix here. We think Facebook can apply the same degree of thought they put into the app into building a brand name of their own. An app about stories shouldn't start with someone else's story.

For instance, in ""A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence And Political Mobilization,"" during the 2010 elections, Facebook users were given the opportunity to ""tell your friends you voted"" by clicking on an ""I voted"" button. Users were 2% more likely to click the button if it was associated with friends who had already voted.[363]","Much more controversially, a 2014 study of ""Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks"" manipulated the balance of positive and negative messages seen by 689,000 Facebook users.[364] The researchers concluded that they had found ""some of the first experimental evidence to support the controversial claims that emotions can spread throughout a network, [though] the effect sizes from the manipulations are small.""[365]","Unlike the ""I voted"" study, which had presumptively beneficial ends and raised few concerns, this study was criticized for both its ethics and methods/claims. As controversy about the study grew, Adam Kramer, a lead author of both studies and member of the Facebook data team, defended the work in a Facebook update. A few days later, Sheryl Sandburg, Facebook's COO, made a statement while traveling abroad.

In its complaint, EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived it users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions: ""At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes. Facebook also failed to inform users that their personal information would be shared with researchers.""[367]","Beyond the ethical concerns, other scholars criticized the methods and reporting of the study's findings. John Grohol, writing for Psych Central, argued that despite its title and claims of ""emotional contagion,"" this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called ""Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count"" or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users' sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet ""I am not happy"" would be scored as positive: ""Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers."" Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the effect size of the findings are little more than a ""statistical blip.""","Kramer et al. (2014) found a 0.07%—that's not 7 percent, that's 1/15th of one percent!!—decrease in negative words in people's status updates when the number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased. Do you know how many words you'd have to read or write before you've written one less negative word due to this effect? Probably thousands.[368]","The consequences of the controversy are pending (be it FTC or court proceedings) but it did prompt an ""Editorial Expression of Concern"" from its publisher, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, as well as an blog posting from OkCupid that ""We experiment on human beings!""

When something entertaining happens in real life, people feel the need to share it. It might seem harmless, however at some point people begin to substitute one reality with another. As a result, people start to change their behavior and even their assumptions about life, love and friendships, based on the Facebook reality. This leads to cognitive dissonance.

Maroon_5,"Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California.[9][10] It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, and keyboardist PJ Morton. Before the current group was established, the original four members, Adam Levine (lead vocals, lead guitar), Jesse Carmichael (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums), formed a band known as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. The band, which self-released an album called We Like Digging?, then signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. After the album garnered a tepid response, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college.","In 2001, the band changed its image by adding guitarist James Valentine and pursuing a different direction under the name Maroon 5.[11] At this point, Carmichael switched to playing keyboards, which has since become his main instrument in the band. After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with a subsidiary of J Records, Octone Records, and released their debut album, Songs About Jane, in June 2002. The album's lead single, ""Harder to Breathe"", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart.[12] In 2004, the album went platinum and has been dubbed ""the sleeper hit of the millennium"". The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, Maroon 5 toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live – Friday the 13th.[13] In 2006, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band then recorded their second album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long and released it in May 2007.[14] The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, ""Makes Me Wonder"", became the band's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100.","In September 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album Hands All Over, which was re-released in 2011 to include the single ""Moves like Jagger"" featuring Christina Aguilera. While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, ""Moves like Jagger"" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100. The band released their fourth album, Overexposed, on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were highly successful on the Billboard Hot 100, including second single ""One More Night"", which reached number one for 9 weeks straight. Keyboardist PJ Morton became an official member of the band in 2012, after gaining little success with his previous albums as an R&B vocalist. The addition of PJ Morton meant that for the first time, Maroon 5 had six official members. The same year, the bass player of Phantom Planet, Sam Farrar, became an official touring member, playing many different instruments (including guitars, percussion and additional keyboards), singing backing vocals and also providing samples and other special effects. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, V. Maroon 5 has sold more than 20 million albums and 70 million singles worldwide.[15][16][17]",,,"Adam Levine was introduced to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist, Adam Salzman. Levine was 15 years old and Dusick was 16.[18] Three of the five members of the band started playing together at age 12. The four original members of the band met while attending Brentwood EMH School in Los Angeles.[19][20] While attending Brentwood EMH School, Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael joined up with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form Kara's Flowers,[21] a rock band. The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a ""collective crush"" on.[20] In 1997, when the band was playing at a beach party in Malibu, independent producer Tommy Allen heard them play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner, songwriter John DeNicola, who is known for his work on Dirty Dancing – including ""(I've Had) The Time of My Life"". Producer Rob Cavallo's management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo to offer them a deal with Reprise Records, re-recording the album.[22] However, after the release of The Fourth World, during Levine and Madden's senior year of high school in 1997, it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s Britpop.[20] Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their lead single, ""Soap Disco"", was a failure.[23] According to Levine, the failure of the album was ""a huge disappointment"" that nearly led them to break up in 1998.[20][24] The album sold around 5,000 copies and the band was dropped after one month.[25]","Dusick and Madden attended college locally at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to attend Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York.[26] While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.[27]","The band returned to the music industry again in 2000.[24] Producer Tim Sommer signed them to a demo deal with MCA Records and produced three tracks with them in Los Angeles in the middle of 2000 with Mark Dearnley engineering. Against Sommer's advice, MCA declined to pick up the band, and these tracks were never released. The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum.[24] While looking for talent for the Octone label, Berkman was given a bunch of demos by the brother of a former colleague at Columbia Records and the song that caught his attention was ""'Sunday Morning'"" which he referred it as a ""genius song"".[25] Berkman was surprised the song was credited to Kara's Flowers because the band sounded completely different from the one he had heard while at Warner Brothers.[28]","Berkman encouraged Diener and Boxenbaum to fly out to Los Angeles to watch a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four-piece Kara's Flowers.[25] After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told HitQuarters he believed what the band needed was a ""fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, so he could be the star I perceived him to be.""[25] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past.[25] Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job.[24] On his joining the band, Valentine commented: ""I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them.""[24]","""Between the time that we started making the album [Songs About Jane] in 2001 and the time the album reached the crest of its success in 2004, we went from being starving musicians wondering what the future held to riding a wave of success beyond our wildest expectations.""","James Valentine attended Berklee College of Music with John Mayer in 1996, where they developed a rapport. In 2002, the two reconnected at a Mayer radio appearance. After Mayer heard their album, he was so impressed (particularly by ""This Love"", which became the most successful release off the album and propelled the band to superstardom) that he invited them to open for him during his early 2003 tour.[20] The first single, ""Harder to Breathe"", slowly started to pick up airplay which helped spur sales of the album. By March 2004, Songs About Jane had reached the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and ""Harder to Breathe"" had made the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts. The album peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 in September 2004,[31] 26 months after its release; this was the longest period between an album's release and its initial Top 10 appearance since SoundScan results were included in the Billboard 200 in 1991.[32] The album went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. This had all happened after the band ""abandoned its post-grunge roots for a radio-friendly pop-soul sound, even while dabbling in hard rock."" [33] Mayer invited the band to open for him again in 2004.[34] Over the next three years, the band toured virtually non-stop, including visits to seventeen countries. During this time, the band toured with Michelle Branch, Graham Colton, and the Rolling Stones.[35][36] Other acts the band toured alongside with included Gavin DeGraw,[37] Matchbox Twenty, Sugar Ray,[38] Counting Crows,[39] Phantom Planet,[40] the Hives,[41] Dashboard Confessional,[42] Simon Dawes,[43] the Thrills, Thirsty Merc, Marc Broussard, the Donnas, the RedWest, Michael Tolcher, and Guster.[44]","Sam Farrar says the Aaliyah song ""Are You That Somebody?"" affected the band and influenced the song ""Not Coming Home.""[20]","Songs About Jane eventually reached No. 1 on the Australian albums (ARIA),[45] while ""Harder to Breathe"" made the Top 20 singles charts in the US[46] and UK,[45] and Top 40 in Australia and New Zealand.[45] The album also eventually climbed to No. 1 in the UK.[45] The second single, ""This Love"", reached No. 5 in the US,[46] No. 3 in the UK, and No. 8 in Australia.[45] The third single, ""She Will Be Loved,"" reached the Top 5 in both the US[46] and the UK, and went to No. 1 in Australia.[45] The fourth single, ""Sunday Morning,"" reached the Top 40 in the US,[46] UK, and Australia.[45] Maroon 5 also played Live 8, in Philadelphia in 2005. Their set included a cover of Neil Young's ""Rockin' In The Free World"" and frontman Levine performed with one of his heroes, and the closing act, Stevie Wonder.[47] On May 13, 2005, in Santa Barbara, California, the band wrapped up the Honda Civic Tour, which it headlined.[48] On June 9, 2005, the band performed at the American Film Institute's tribute to filmmaker George Lucas. Lucas himself had selected Maroon 5 for the event, as it was his children's favorite band at the time.[49] Over the years of touring with the band their drummer, percussionist and backing vocalist Ryan Dusick had been suffering from the touring life.[50] The strains of non-stop touring aggravated an old sports injury.[19] After several absences from the tour with Ryland Steen and Josh Day taking his place, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 in September 2006.[30] Matt Flynn, the former drummer of Gavin DeGraw and the B-52's, joined the band as Dusick's replacement.[51]","After recording for 8 months in 2006, Maroon 5's second album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long, was released worldwide in May 2007 by A&M Octone Records.[52] According to Levine, the follow-up to Songs About Jane is ""sexier and stronger"",[53] gaining inspiration from iconic 80s artists such as Prince, Shabba Ranks, Michael Jackson and Talking Heads.[54] Ann Powers writing for Los Angeles Times said It Won't Be Soon Long is ""An icy-hot blend of electro-funk and blue-eyed soul that works its cruel streak with the confidence of Daniel Craig's James Bond"".[55] Before its release, ""Makes Me Wonder"" was the No. 1 selling single and video on iTunes.[53] It was also the No. 1 selling album, with more than 50,000 digital pre-sales.[53] After its release, the album broke iTunes sales records its week of release, selling over 101,000 albums.[56] The first single, ""Makes Me Wonder,"" was released to radio March 27, 2007. The song debuted at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100, the lowest debuting single of the group's five chart entries. In the first week of May, the single skyrocketed from a lowly position of No. 64 to No. 1, the biggest jump in Billboard history at the time.[57] ""Makes Me Wonder"" has also achieved No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs, Pop 100, and Hot Dance Club Play charts.[58]","To support the album, the band performed on a ""six-date club tour"" in which it visited small venues in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Miami, and New York City in early June 2007.[59] The band followed with a concert that streamed live via MSN Music in mid-June.[60] On July 10, it opened for The Police, in Miami,[61] and followed with an acoustic performance at the Miami club, Studio A, the next day.[62] Their It Won't Be Soon Before Long world tour took place in 2007, where the band toured 28 cities in North America.

Maroon 5 also performed during the 2014 iTunes Festival at the Roundhouse in London, England, on September 11, 2014 (all of the concerts played as part of the festival were filmed and webcast live, around the world).[101] The second single from V, ""Animals"", was first featured in a Kia Soul commercial and made available for free download on the official Kia website for a limited time after the advert premiered on August 21, 2014.[102] The song has so far peaked on number 3 on the Hot 100 chart.[97]","Maroon 5 performed at the Grammy Awards' Christmas special, entitled ""A Very Grammy Christmas,"" on November 18, 2014 and at Z100's Jingle Ball on December 12, 2014.[103][104]","""Sugar"" was released as the third single from the album on January 14, 2015.

City, and PHASES.[111] June 25, 2016, the 15th anniversary of Songs About Jane's release, had the celebration of #Maroon5Day, in a partnership with UNICEF to support children in need of health care.[112][113]","In November 2015, guitarist James Valentine spoke about the band's strategy moving onto their sixth studio album, saying the group wanted ""to make a more traditional record next ... like the way we made Songs About Jane, just sitting in a room with our instruments and slugging it out. It’s been fun to experiment on the last couple of records with the more electronic sounds, but maybe we’ve gone as far as we can with that for now.""[114]","The band released a single featuring Kendrick Lamar, titled ""Don't Wanna Know"", to Top 40 radio on October 18, 2016.[115]","On January 13, 2017, it was revealed by singer Adam Levine that the band is currently working on their sixth studio album.[116] According to Levine, the album will be released ""soonish"", and will be R&B-influenced.[117]","Another single titled ""Cold"", featuring American rapper Future, was released to Top 40 radio on February 14, 2017.[118]","""I think the classic Maroon 5 song is minor, and it has some funk, Nile Rodgers-style guitar and the lyrics are probably about getting your heart broken. So minor, funk and heartbreak -- that’s the Maroon 5 formula.""","Adam Levine has stated: ""[E]verything that's written and performed and put together pretty much comes from us. I just think people would be surprised to know that we’re a self-contained unit. We’re a band that does their own thing. There’s no puppet master.""[120] However, in an article about the songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed that at least some of the band's songs, such as ""Moves like Jagger,"" are the product of efforts by, or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers.[121] In the same article, Levine says, ""It's almost as if [Benny Blanco] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about the collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best.""[122]","The band has cited Elita 5, Michael Jackson, The Police, the Bee Gees, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, Tonic, Prince, Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye as influences.[123][124] Adam Levine has also cited Billy Joel as an influence.[47] Furthermore, guitarist James Valentine said he was influenced by guitarists like Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell and John Scofield, as well as the rock band Queens of the Stone Age.[125] The band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by piano or synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost love; songs like ""This Love"", ""Makes Me Wonder"" and ""Misery"" have a very cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship, while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as ""She Will Be Loved"" and ""Never Gonna Leave This Bed"" express a longing for a romantic relationship. ""Makes Me Wonder"" has a secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the Iraq War.[126]","The band's style changes from album to album. Songs About Jane consists of songs about Levine's ex-girlfriend Jane. On It Won't Be Soon Before Long, however, the songs are less personal and are more electric with more use of synthesizers, creating a retro feel. Hands All Over continues the band's lost love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single ""Moves like Jagger"", an electropop song which represents a drastic change in the band's sound, with more of a dance feel to it. ""It was one of those songs that was definitely a risk,"" Levine said. ""It's a bold statement. We've never really released a song like that. But it's exciting to do something different, do something new. I'm just glad that everyone likes it.""[127] James Valentine called Overexposed ""our most 'pop' record ever and we weren’t shy about really going for it.""[128] They also have experimented with new wave[129][130][131] and disco[132][133] sounds on several albums.","Maroon 5 have been the recipients of three Grammy Awards,[134] three American Music Awards,[135][136][137] four Billboard Music Awards, and four Teen Choice Awards.[138] In 2004 World Music Awards, it won the award for ""World's Best New Group"".[139] In 2012, Maroon 5 won the People's Choice award for Favorite Band.[140]","Hands All Over, the band's third studio album, which was released in September 2010, peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 chart.
